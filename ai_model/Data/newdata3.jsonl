{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I'm driving a car in a world I am familiar with, it's a video game world, more specifically the Grand Theft Auto world. (I’ve never really played the game by the way, IF I played it, my time was spent driving around legally, not even speeding. So it’s safe to say I haven’t really played it) I realize the cops are chasing me, no small amount of cops, cars and policemen on foot. I'm an evil man (woman in real life btw which is interesting as well), a criminal. I drive fast and recklessly and I’m running through several doors, up and down stairs….Soon I've gotten rid of the cops, they're not after me anymore. I'm in an empty house that’s still being built, it’s basically still just an iron structure (similar to the one in The Dark Knight when Batman and Joker battle)…I'm not alone, Aragorn (Lord of the Rings) is there fighting me and he has a sword, I also have a sword. We are hanging on iron pillars and fencing. I get a hold of his sword and I kick him off the building, I watch him fall while I hang there.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was in a huge house with a bunch of friends, some of whom I recognized. It was pretty obvious that we were there to party and it seemed like a cabin in the woods. At one point, we talk about going onto the roof and the staircase is a spiral going up at least 10 floors on the outside. One of the women seems to speed up it like sonic the hedgehog in front of me. On the roof, it’s obvious we are in a mountain town and it’s lit with string lights and super pretty. An old man comes up from what seems to be a ladder on the side of the building on the other side from us and he motions to us saying something like, hey is this yours? He seems like a grounds keeper or building manager. We walk over and there’s a few benches with towels and unwrapped (but really neatly laid) condoms on them. I said something like “no, that must have been the people here before us?” And I had this grossed out feeling. He acts a bit funny about it, seems to be mad at us and then leaves. We keep talking and then he appears again right in front of us coming over onto the roof but this time he seems like he’s turned into an alien with a squid-like face. One of the guy leans down towards him and all of a sudden I become the alien and I shoot my tentacles at his mouth, punch a hole I.

The behavior towards the presumed Animus symbol and it toward you, might suggest a difficulty you perhaps have in incorporating certain masculine aspects into your personality. [END]"}
{"prompt":"Dream_Text: In my dream I saw a blonde girl. She was cute; not the most attractive person, but for some reason she appealed to me more than many beauties. She was dressed in a very simple way, her clothes were light blue and pink. She was a magician. She invited me to join a club she belonged to herself. In this club magicians could meet, talk, spend time together. I was tempted to join, but I was not ready to commit myself, because that would mean I'd have to attend the first meeting immediately, so I just said I would consider it for next time. She was slightly disappointed. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" The Blonde girl is a magician illusionist, sorcerer, witch, enchanter, charmer, satanist, siren to name but a few. You say she was cute: attractive in a dainty way, appealing, delightful, charming. Acquired some cute mannerisms etc The blond girl is in fact a young woman this is what you find appealing, she’s not a Marilyn Monroe neither is she a dumb blonde( as the saying goes) but she is a young woman and innocent and the blonde hair represents her fair skin. To you you have found a woman untarnished by worldly living. She is appealing because with you she will continue to grow untainted such as the many beauties you refer to. These beauties also have many qualities such as shape, color or form that pleases the senses. Notice your young woman is fair this is what really appeals to you rather than exotic colors etc. You are not so much looking to please the outward senses rather you are looking for inner content and satisfaction. However in this case this young girl is a witch/ magician. Even the way she is dresses is not loud or outlandish, the colors are there but again they are fair colors again suggesting an innocence “she is dressed in a simple way” there are many meanings for the colors however the simplistic meaning may suggest this simple young woman is thinking of marriage and a family the blue for a boy the pink for a girl if this is the case then marriage and children appeal more to you than temporary relationships. She was a Magician, as described a witch an illusionist. This sweet young girl is casting her spell over you, beware! Now that she has got your attention she takes her next step, not to come home and meet the family, no, but to join her club, the Magicians club, it’s here where she wants to marry you in, beware again! She belonged to this club not just a member but “belonging”suggesting something far more e.g. a generational thing with rules and codes etc, a place to socialize with other like minded people to discuss methods to ply their trade. A place to “meet” this is what she wants a place to meet, a place to join to get her. YOU ARE TEMPTED to join. Please note very clearly your dream has turned from appealing to TEMPTATION. You were not ready because you were not ready to commit. You were tempted to just go there no strings attached. The strings of attachment on the first meeting would obviously mean having your name published in the membership and first of all learning the new magical skills as an induction process of which you probably don’t agree with. You said you would consider it the next time meaning that the temptation for the young woman is still there, unfortunately you can’t seperate the appealing young woman from the magical witch. She is a little disappointed meaning she will try again. BEWARE! [END]"}

Still their names but either with a night/dream pun or some night/dream logo. The person idk (Let’s call him P, I guess) sat on a bench and I ask them wth is going on, they confirm it was my town but that it’s called Whoville now. Very confused, we walk into this shop. The manager is walking around shouting ‘Make sure […] don’t fall asleep in my shop!’. Some guy looks drunk and as if he’s going to fall asleep. P helps him out of the shop and he’s grateful. Soon after, the shops begin to close and the place looks dark and gloomy. All the shops looked as if they were abandoned. Broken windows, lights, and cafés had food laying around. People walking around went into different shops. A group of women were in this café next to me and began eating. Quickly, they all collapsed. P complains that this is just like ‘so and so shop’ and that people just shouldn’t take the risk anymore! I quickly realised that they were all dead. (For some reason) I and P break the windows of a real estate shop and see this very old, short man with black hair and small glasses. He wore old fashioned but fancy clothes. We talk to him for a bit, ask him questions etc. Turns out that you can either leave your shop in view or hide it. If you leave it in view you can leave a light on to let people know […]. He said that it was stupid and he would never do that. He continues to talk and I look over to see candles lit at a window. I quickly blew them out so that he wouldn’t notice. They came back. I repeated this until I ran to a lever that hid the shop. All of the windows were now gone, replaced by wood. The man ran out back and we followed. (Idk what happened next) ((THIS IS THE PART I REMEMBER DREAMING ABOUT BEFORE)) He gives in and starts talking about the town and his childhood. Under this shop, there was a huge cavern. As a kid, he and some townsfolk went down there (for some reason). All of a sudden, he found this girl around his age. She wore a gorgeous blue dress and bonnet with white trim. They talked and talked and they had a great time. The town and he all had to escape the cavern and he begged the girl to come. He dragged her up all the scaffolding with the town. Just as they reached the door back into the shop, part of the scaffolding was gone. The town (already on the other side) tried to help but there wasn’t much they could do. He held onto her and she begged him to leave her here and he jumped successfully to the door. He said ‘We made it!’. But then the girl, still in his arms, said that she wasn’t finished here yet and like a snake slithered out of his arms and fell back into the cavern. The man said that he had stayed there for years hoping to finally be able to save that girl. I and P both nodded toward each other and we went out the back door and began our climb down into the cavern, the man not far behind us. With our flashlights, we looked around for ages. Eventually, we found the girl who wore the same blue dress. The man was ecstatic and began to talk to her. All was well until all of a sudden she began to transform into this huge snake-like creature (with small legs and she was still wearing the dress). (I don’t remember why but) She began to attack us. Quickly, we ran back up the scaffolding and into the shop. She slithered her way up and partially through the door. ;  Background_Info: I’ve had this dream before.

There was an apartment full of my ex-wife and her siblings, but they weren’t her real siblings. They were in the process of moving out of the apartment. I was there, frantically going from person to person, trying to figure out what was going on. It seemed to everyone like the most natural thing in the world, and my vehement protest was viewed as outlandish and inappropriate. I was distraught and desperately tried to make them see. “What is going on!?” Then I was riding a horse through a sort of natural area, a national park. I saw that some belts had been discarded. I picked one up like a whip. I rode my horse downhill. It was hilly country, with grass and water and a view of a far distant country at a lower elevation. Then I was back at the apartment. There was a Asian person there, of ambiguous gender. I asked this person to come back to the bedroom with the aim of seducing them.

My suspicion is that the dream characters are symbols of aspects of yourself and not about those people external to you in waking. In that context I'd see your child as either an inner child aspect or maybe, and I think given the scene with the car as a symbol of the personal journey this is how I would lean, that he is a symbol of your personal development (the new version if you that has come out of you). Your partner I think is representing your intellect (masculine as thinking vs feminine as feeling). So I would see this as saying your inner child or developing self has been attacked but you don't understand how or why, and are intellectually refusing to contemplate it. And in that refusal you are as a result also refusing to continue your journey (not driving). I think the walker might be tied to that too, like you have the option to engage your analytical mind and figure what is causing this issue and resolve the problem at its root, or you can stop your personal growth journey, put up with the symptoms (walker as a support dealing with being in a disabled state).

Also, sometimes it seems to be nighttime, when it's just that you're weary and not with the right company and rest. When you get the right company and rest, it feels more like daytime, because we have more energy, whether it is or isn't literally. I'd say make sure your mom knows you appreciate her too. A saying comes to mind, \"Don't grow weary in doing well, because in due time, you will reap a harvest.\" Never underestimate planting, no matter how long that season lasts.

The Bison is out of its normal territory and subject to the others within the group because it is been overpowered by them. The Bison is on the line,suspended online by the ropes.

The public display of ridicule is indeed torture to the Bison who is completely out of its depth and now helpless and unable to defend itself?

I guess slightly less literal possibilities could include a death & rebirth of some aspect within the context of your current life. Or, perhaps it might relate to the the Age of Pisces we're currently all living through, which is nearing it's end as we head towards the Age of Aquarius. This could also have associations with religious symbolism relating to Jesus and the symbol of the fish. I was listening to Alan Watts yesterday, and he mentioned in passing his opinion that Jesus may very well have been a real person who had experiences of what Alan said \"we call cosmic consciousness\", and that Jesus had claimed that he was God incarnate. In Jungian terms this experience would be a psyche - or ego death. Your dream reminded me of this, and there is an aspect of your dream which I'd say is quite unusual in that your identity had shifted, that you were not \"you\", but a fish. So there are common themes of a revealed surprising nature of identity, death, rebirth, and the fish through both the biblical story and your dream. Interesting that you had not died and become a fish, at least within this dream, but were already a fish and were contemplating dying and being reborn as a human again, knowing that you were once human before. The waters clearing as you got further and further away from the human domain is also interesting. Swimming near the surface might be related to your then state of consciousness as you dreamed.

That's when my dads wife came in and I became angry, telling her I was going to take the baby as it was obvious she was unfit to take care of her. She was pretty calm during the whole interaction but tried to take her baby back, but eventually relented and went back to her room while I changed the baby. By the end of it all, I realized that I was just overreacting. At least, in terms of the baby, as it wasn't like she had been crying and put two and two together and figured the baby had probably just made a mess and it wasn't his wife's fault. However, there was definitely no excusing the neglected dog. I went into her room with the baby and apologized, telling her I knew she was a good mom and that I was sorry for attempting to take her baby, that I knew she would never forgive me if I had taken her. His wife told me it was alright, that the reason why she didn't fight so hard is because she knew I would make the right decision. She then told me, for whatever reason, that if I wanted from now on I could come and fold her laundry and she's pay me $1.75 every time I did her laundry.

It was evident that the home had been assembled quickly without regard. There was a non-occupant vehicle parked next to the vehicle that I was in. Despite the vehicle being new, there were visible scratches. Suddenly, the vehicle that I was in started to roll backwards. I struggled to stop the vehicle, but managed to figure it just moments prior to it rolling in the street . The vehicle's interior was quiet unique, and not at all what I am accustomed to. I couldn't figure out how to drive the vehicle forward towards the house. My husband came along to explain a few things about the vehicle. The dream changed and I was now sitting in the rear. There was a woman sitting in the driver's seat. Without warning the woman transformed into a dark green lizard. I was so frightened that I ran out of the vehicle.

These also put me in a funk for a few days after too and makes me grieve for him harder. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" Maybe it is symbolic. In your dream he is moving on and telling you to let him go. Maybe it is your subconscious \"screaming\" at you to let him go and move on with your life. I know when a loved one passes it sometimes feels like you're not supposed to feel happy anymore because they are gone and moving on with your life would feel like a disrespect to their memory. I felt like that when my dad passed so I can imagine that feeling would be even stronger with a spouse. Maybe your dreams are about your inner conflict where you are torn between grieving him and wanting to stop grieving but feeling like you are supposed to grieve forever. Also, if you believe that loved ones can visit you in your dreams from the other side, it could be taken as a message from him that he wants you to move on and be happy without him. If you had passed instead of him, would you want him to be miserable and miss you for the rest of his life or would you be screaming at him from the other side to find happiness and live for the both of you? Just a thought. The other woman he left you for in your dream could just symbolize him leaving you in this world to be in the next. Even though it wasn't his choice to leave you in reality, that doesn't mean you don't hold anger inside at losing him, whether that anger is at him, or God, or the universe, pain often presents itself in the form of anger. It isn't fair that you lost him, and you feel wronged. Anger is a stage of grief. If you haven't processed your grief fully in your waking life, it will come out in weird ways in your subconscious. I have bizarre dreams of my dad all the time too. [END]"}

On Friday night though, as I was running away, I moved into another dream where I was running down a stone cavernous hallway. I'm running away from something but I'm not sure what. I keep coming to wooden doors with ironwork designs on them and unlocking them with my old fashioned, black iron key. From around the right corner, before I run to each door, there is a woman with dark hair and eyes in a pink dress towing a mule on a rope. She walks around the corner before I run down the hallway where each door is so I see her 3 or 4 times as if I'm running down the same hallways again 4 times. I never look to see if she is coming from somewhere so I don't know if there is actually a corridor she's coming from. Eventually, I run through one of the doors and there was a white field. I hear a voice behind me and it's a futuristic-looking boy of about 18 (picture cyberpunk goggles and dystopian future-looking clothing). He says something and before I can hear it, I realize I'm dreaming, wake up and I ask him, \"What are you doing here? Who are you? Why am I having this dream and what and I supposed to learn?\" He smiles coyly and says I can only learn that if I promise I'm still dreaming. I say yes and he leads me back around to where I previously saw the next wooden door in the fully white field, but now there is cobblestone and an old town. I've been here before but only during summer when he place looked like a mystical campground. Now it looks dark, cold and snowy. All the people are silhouettes and faceless. The boy leads me around the block and speaks but I can't really hear him. I'm more focused on the silhouette people (if you've seen inception, the people moved in a similar way except they were only shadows). There was also nobody in the houses.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: In my dream last night, I was back in school and trying to fit studying for exams into my work schedule for next week. As my literature class is starting, I turn over or open my books so that the titles of their fronts are not visible to the teacher. She is a youngish woman dressed in flowing black clothing. She looks down at my books, noticing a black and white photo and a headline concerning esotericism and the arts. She smiles slightly and as she starts the lesson, she asks me if I can name a 19th century writer heavily inspired by the occult ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" You are studying literature in between your work schedule. This week you need to study to find the answers, next week you need to be fully competent with what you have learned. Literature: What Is Literature? Simply put, literature represents the culture and tradition of a language or a people. Perhaps on one hand (as seen in the black and white photo) you desire to study the traditions of your culture Eg literature. On the other hand you you seem to be combining your cultural and traditional study which another side of your literature (again see black and white) The white side of your study is open to all and perhaps public. The black side absorbs from the white side therefore I say you are combining your study of traditional literature with deeper aspects connected to this study. As your literature class is starting we find you have “your books” perhaps the dark/black side of learning combined with what is being taught at your class the white side. “Your books are turned over so that the titles and authors are not exactly “visible” this is to hide your deeper study of literature and expand it to the occult. Some of “your books” are “open” allowing others to know a little about you. The titles are not visible but your teacher knows what you are studying just by looking at them because she is familiar with them even without knowing the titles or authors. The teacher understands the significance of the black and white photo on your open book. Some parts of your study are open but other parts are not yet fully disclosed Just as the photo is black and white so also is the way you are learning and so also is the teacher teaching. The headline in the photo “esotericism and the arts”. Esotericism is about secret knowledge for a small group of people.[1] Esotericism also describes mystical, spiritual or occult viewpoints (point of view).[2] Esotericism studies Gnosticism, Yoga, Alchemy, Magic, Spiritualism, Hypnosis, Astrology, Meditation, Mysticism, and Occultism. Many[who?] followers of Abrahamic faiths, particularly Christianity and Islam, have criticized Esotericism as black magic.[source?] Esotericism in religion is called \"obscurantism\". Esotericism can also be about understanding symbolism and hidden meanings of many different books. They include religious books, philosophy books and books about history. They use these books as their texts.[3] So we see the dark and black side perhaps as occultism and black magic? What you are wanting to study on the black side is much more than your traditional culture. The teacher begins her class with a question? “Can you name a 19th century writer that was heavily inspired by the Occult?” You possibly can because you have your books there which she probably knows what they are? Not sure about this but by naming the author will reveal what you have learned “Can you name them” she’s asking you make known the titles of your books that you have hidden on your desk? Perhaps by naming them they are integrated from the black side and more to the white side? [END]"}
{"prompt":"Dream_Text: First, a scene involving a pedal bike, in working order though slightly haphazard condition, the chain nearly came off but didn't, oil was needed, vegetable oil was suggested. Next, my dad was fiddling with a newly rewired, large electrical box he'd constructed. I made a statement of it being 'the most complex for a simple operation', my dad replied that it was all good except 'occasionally doesn't work' at all. This I think was set in my childhood home, which has a workshop/studio room. Either my dad or myself commented on a cover of a plug socket being rather dirty, but on closer inspection the clear plastic cover which was semi translucent wasn't because it was dirty, but because it was the type of plastic which was glow in the dark when charged up by placing it near light first. For a good deal of time I was wandering around trying to find a light bulb to hold this piece of plastic near to see it glow, I never was able to find one. As I did, the small workshop room became a vast room the size of a large field with many people spread around the far perimeters engaged in a variety of very different activities. Next scene, I'm at a table, outside somewhere else, with my mum and several others sat around it. My mouth feels uncomfortable and I retrieve a selection of small brown beads threaded onto on strings from my mouth.

I look at a wall leading along the side of an alley which led to an opening to a street below, it has a sign pinned on part of it with some words I forget now. As I look at it it was like a sped up timelapse occurred and the sign weathered away, deteriorated, became illegible and disappeared. The passageway beside that wall then got covered over by buildings, I sensed the route/passage had been moved to the right somewhat, like I'd witnessed the development of a town layout change over time. I then find myself stood nearby beside my sister, still atop the slight hill in a town, I was standing in a slightly puffed up imposing way, again aware of beads in my mouth, fetching a few more up. Some people walked by, I recognised the voice of a rapper who I listened to years ago, he was rhyming aloud, I felt my mood change from my fake imposing demeanor to a happy interested one, the rapper walked on around the corner, and one of his crew, a tall guy said I should call him and get in touch. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" There are a lot of details to consider here!

This is why the Indian lady who understands all this is trying to help you? Repetition is a way of learning, She repeatedly try’s to reach you how you must pace your candle on the table.\r\nThe elephant in the room. You have an elephant and another large creature “strange” strange 1. unusual or surprising; difficult to understand or explain. \"children have some strange ideas\" Similar: unusual odd curious peculiar A white spider like creature with upturned claws confined under the elephants legs and harmless. What’s happening here? The elephant that perhaps has been mistreated at one stage and now struggles looks to the creature for help just as the Indian lady try’s to help you. The creature gives you what you need. An infusion of neon illuminated spots glowing briefly. Neon: a chemical element that is a gas with no smell or color, does not react with other chemicals, and shines red when an electric current goes through it: You have received a new light and it’s glowing a new or revived spirit and now the elephant walks toward you!

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: i dreamed last night of being in a residential neighborhood and seeing a yellow dog. hanging out near me. it was some kind of an exotic variety. after that, I saw a lioness or some kind of large fenine. It came up to me. Me hand was in it's mouth and it was biting down. I understood that it was not to hurt me,. this was affectionate, so I sort of \"snuggled\" with it. In the dream, during this, I was thinking of when i grew up with house cat from my childhood that used to play-bite. I was vaguely conscious of other people watching this and i had communicated to them that the animal was only playing. While the feline tightened it's clamp on my hand/arm, though still not hurting, i still had the sense that thise thing could really do some damage on a whim, while I continued to snuggle. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" At first glance the dog is suggestive of mans best friend and even a helper, however we notice your dog is a yellow dog, suggesting a further meaning beyond just that of a friendly helper? the word you use to further describe your dog is \"exotic\" meaning; unusual and exciting because of coming from a far away especially a tropical country. So now we have an exciting and unusual dog who comes from far away and is naturally meant to be helpful and friendly to people in your neighborhood, we don't yet know if this dog has a bite to it? (maybe by now you know who the yellow dog is? The lioness meaning is the model for a woman, shes magnificent full of passion and beauty her presence is commanding and she protects her young. they are independent fierce loyal and brave and they are the primary hunters for their pride. As with the dog who is given a descriptive yellow colour the lioness also is given us further description. The biting down affectionately, without hurting you seems to be what a lioness would do to lovingly carry her young with her teeth without hurting them. The next thing we see is you snuggling into the lioness, shes a loving mother and you are her cub. but now we see that this fierce mother figure who is protective of her cubs and bites without hurting has your hand in its mouth. And yet she is not biting to hurt, she was affectionate. what is she doing? It does seem she is leading you? its possible that you have become a dog handler now your lioness is handling you in the right direction perhaps. you can be sure of this as compared with the exotic dog where you don't really know what to expect? the idea i get here is that i wouldn't be too trusting to allow the yellow dog to have your hand in its mouth? This affectionate scene reminds you of the house cat perhaps your real mother who used to do the same thing to play bite while all the while protecting you. You are conscious of other people watching, perhaps they think the treatment you are getting is over the top but you assure them its quite ok.A t the last we see the lioness tightening her grip on you you but still not hurting you. So here it is its a \"struggle\" for you and as you continue to struggle your lioness continues to tighten her hold on your arm. The yellow dog in your dream is supposed to be friendly and helpful however this dog has not displayed any of these loving attributes at all, unlike your lioness who has done a wonderful job of loving you and looking after you.

It could also be a play on words linking to what you \"saw\"? The daughter could be a symbol for someone who can \"relate\" to this experience hence may not be a family member? In fact she could even be a symbol of part of your character, perhaps unwanted or aggressive advances being shot down because of your past experiences? Not necessarily forced but even just moving too fast as dreams can exaggerate?

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was together with a group of settlers. We were me, a warrior and a few others who weren't warriors. We needed to build a place to live in the wild. We found a hillside with grass that seemed good. We started collecting things and I followed the warriors lead. There came some attacking us, two of them were gnomes/dwarves. I managed to keep them at a distance with my knife but given the opportunity I didn't manage to hurt them. I just drew the knife alongside the gnome's cheek and there came a little blood.

The warrior is an archetypal figure that many of us dream of. He is the hero found in many stories. Brave, bold and confident. Able to tackle life's challenges and push through against all obstacles and opponents. He fights for truth, he stands against all that is \"bad\" in this world and stands up proudly for what he believes is right. The dream calls you to be the warrior in your own life. Living in the wild is about finding your own sense of authenticity. To be who you are in your most natural state. Being unafraid and unashamed in your own sense of self, that who you are, what you believe on and how you want to show the that to the world. As you move into the position of the wild authentic warrior you may come across those who wish to attack you, to see you fail or knock you down. Because they themselves are challenged by your sense of pride and confidence in who you are. They will not want you to change, to move away from their control or believe about who you are or who you should be. The gnomes show that you feel yourself to be \"bigger\" than them. They are no real threat to you when you stand in your power, but they can cause some trouble so best to keep your distance. I feel you have given these people a taste of your new found strength and confidence, but you do not seek to really hurt them. \" I really tried to become more ruthless but it was hard\" I feel this is true of your life right now. It is hard to move away from compliance and move towards agency. You do have to be ruthless, you have to put yourself and your own needs first. I feel the baby shoes on the ground are a symbol of the immature steps you have taken in life on the road to maturity. Perhaps in the past others have had to clear up after you If you have made any bad decisions etc. Perhaps there is some clearing up for you to do now as you learn to deal with your own affairs.

This tribe’s king whilst leading his tribe lifted a scepter of gold in the air and proclaimed “I AM ONE KING, BUT TO ALL!” The planet they were on had a bright blue tint and the stars shown brightly. The second tribe were a tribe of alien, yet humanoid people.

In the 3rd planet there are creatures(not men and women yet, not fully developed, children perhaps). And one of them that stood in 2 legs(babies and infants can't walk, they crawl at best) claimed himself king again. Purple hue and pink stars! Purple is a middle ground between blue and pink. Altough children have primary sexual features as different genitalia, they don't have secondary ones that able you to differentiate unless by different clothing and haircuts and maybe behavior, but not by physical appearance, hence the colour purple.

I told her to tell the kid he could stay here, in this room until he could go home or figure something out. The boy never showed up in the dream, but somewhere around that conversation is when things started to go wrong. My friend took a shower and saw someone looking at her from the drain. We checked every drain, and every drain in the house had someone looking through it. Like all you could see was the eyeball, looking up. The floorboards were suddenly rotten, they looked fine, but I’d step on them and they’d start to collapse down. I fell through the floor and into the basement of the house. I contacted an insurance agent, and when I explained the issues he started to laugh, hysterically. Then that scene disappeared and suddenly I was someone else, a teen girl, trying desperately to pretend I went to a school I know I didn’t, trying to get this group of people to let me go somewhere with them. And not in the way of a teen just wanting to be included, they were doing something dangerous or bad and this girl, for some reason, needed to gain their trust, have them underestimate her, so she could find out what it was. It felt like her life depended on it. They ended up letting her tag along, but I woke up as soon as they started to walk away with her. ;  Background_Info: I don’t dream too often, and when I do they’re always so strange and I can never make sense of them, ;  Wakeup_State:  This one left me a little freaked out. ###","completion":" The house represents you I think, and doing a self spring clean, going through changes. The seven stories are particularly interesting if you know anything about the chakras.

I read it as you becoming uncomfortable as you go through these changes, perhaps feel you were not quite as great as you previously considered perhaps. I think that’s why you become a teenage girl, a period of time of self discovery, going through a new \"coming of age\"- process. [END]"}

It could be an indication of the old age of the things which are now coming up, which I think the unconscious seems to naturally do gradually over time. I'd guess that here, Jordan Peterson represents an aspect of your unconscious, and his repulsion from you seems to be simply on the basis of confronting it. Perhaps it illustrates the often antagonistic relationship between ego and the unconscious, which dream analysis and shadow work aims to reconcile. Perhaps more simply, the dream could be seen to say that Jordan Peterson has been your sole, principal teacher, and one that you have now 'repelled' in a sense, walked away from. [END]"}

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was smoking a cigarette, walking by a busy and narrow street. This place looks like a favela, although much cleaner and the ambiance was happy and full of energy. Unlike the slums where I used to live where it smells piss and dead rats. It was the first time I have dreamed of such a place. I was about to cross the street when I noticed the people started running out of this man’s way. This guy was riding a scooter. He was wearing a denim cap, green long sleeve shirt, light wash pants and a pair of slippers. On his back was a sheath with a long and heavy machete with blood on it. He also had a gun but I can’t recall if it was a shotgun or a rifle. I felt something very evil and sinister as he went past me. Then I went to this share house, upstairs where I was supposed to be living: talked to my housemates and did some other things I couldn’t recall, but I’m pretty sure those parts were fun that I forgot about the guy in the green shirt. I climbed the staircase and opened the door at the end and there I was on the rooftop smoking another cigarette. This share house was relatively taller than most buildings that I could watch the neighbors through their windows, the street market and the people walking around. It felt very calm. Then this woman busted out of the door - also wearing a green shirt - shaking and crying, begging for help. This woman was bleeding all over and I could see one of her eyes sticking out of her face with a huge open wound on her temple showing her cracked skull. I asked her what happened and she said “he’s here”. Then I remembered the man with a green shirt. Then the mood of that dream turned into something out of a horror movie. The sky turned blood red. The people around were shouting “watch out! Lock your doors!”, warning the others including me. The commotion kept getting closer and closer; the kind of noise you would hear from people screaming in terror. Then I heard loud thuds inside the share house and the footsteps on the staircase. I realized that he was after the woman. I shouted at the neighbors to call the cops. I locked the door on the rooftop from the outside with just a slide lock using a concrete nail as the barrel bolt. That way it could buy us some time at least. I grabbed her and we jumped and ran on the roof of other houses and shacks. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" This is a dream about your shadow and the Anima plain and simple. The shadow is the part of the psyche that compensates for one-sidedness in the ego. For example if you become too self righteous in some area your shadow becomes darker in compensation. In dreams it shows up for a man as a male ‘other’ or a dark and sinister place. In the case of this dream it is both. The Woman is the Anima. The anima is the relating factor of the psyche and it helps us relate to both our inner world and outer world. It shows up in a man’s dreams or fantasies as a woman or animal. It is usually projected onto a woman since one of its roles is to help in relating to a mate for the continuation of the species which is a vital role. It is usually misinterpreted as an inner woman. It’s not. It’s an aspect of the male psyche that gets projected onto a woman. Now, the interesting part. When we go inward to our collective Unconscious, the first thing we usually encounter is our shadow. Like I said, when the ego becomes too one sided, the shadow activates as a compensatory mechanism to bring the psyche back into homeostasis. While this self regulation is happening, we lose the connection with our relating factor, the Anima (for a woman Animus). When we lose touch with our Anima, when it is clouded over by the shadow, we lose touch with our deeper instinctive self and it’s impulses. This manifests an internal psychological pressure which may come in the form of anxiety or anger. It’s kind of an instinct ‘wounding’. Another interesting thought is the wound on the eye of the Anima. It’s the dreams way of showing you that while the shadow is active, it is not able to perform its task of looking inward or outward to full capacity. [END]"}

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was at a beach, and there was an odd looking vehicle a bit like a tractor with its large back wheels, except this vehicle had no visible wheels at the front, and even larger rear wheels. I was aware that it was once above the sea level, on the sandy banks of the beach, but time had passed and I then witnessed it submerged just below the surface of the sea. I saw some people disappear below the water level and apparently get into the cabin, when it then rapidly, with unusual speed power and ease, reversed out of where it was submerged sunken in the sand offshore, back up onto the high sandy banks of the beach. Then this event was set back in time, ready to replay again, only with myself as an active participant in it, needing to prepare to do what I'd seen the people do - get into the cabin, and get the vehicle back out the sea onto the steep, sandy banks of the beach. There were a couple of odd scenes that were never seen or featured when I witnessed the first overview of events initially, I had a one half of a plastic clip like that found on a backpack or luggage (pictured), partly broken, which was presumably attached to the vehicle at one end, that I connected to the other half of the clip presumably attached to the sandy bank, one of the actual plastic clips was broken but I connected it to the other half precariously. I recall mentioning how seemingly ridiculous this feeble link was for the job at hand. Then, equally absurdly, I was handling some thin string which again might've been attached to the clip, which I was threading onto something fixed on the bank on the beach. Then was a sense of time urgency, and I along with a few others were standing atop the steep sandy banks of the beach, preparing to head to the sunken vehicle, submerge ourselves in the cold ocean and enter the cabin before getting the vehicle out from beneath the sea, where it was stuck deep into the sand, submerged. We were putting on wetsuits. I asked another \"do I need to take my top off?\" before putting on the wetsuit, \"yes\". Putting my arm into the sleeve of the suit I noticed just how thick the material was, several inches thick, enough to keep me from being shocked from the cold ocean temperature, so thick I might not even notice the temperature change at all. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" The Tractor.: Maybe your conscience? It has no front wheels therefore it’s designed not to steer to the left or the right just forward and reverse and keep you on tracks d give you great traction. The 2 functions may simply be right wrong? The large wheels enable traction for daily life when applied daily. At the first the Tractor is anchored on solid ground by the sea (sub conscience) the tractor was originally above sea level where the conscience is supposed to be to help us out with our daily living to make good decisions on a daily basis. But over time time we notice the tractor has become submerged. What caused the tractor to get submerged? If the tractor is the conscience then it has a daily function to help us get through each day providing traction for our daily work? Then at night it rests as we sleep and the sub conscience takes over. This cycle is performed on a daily basis just like the sea. The sea also has a daily rhythm, the tide goes out the tide comes in each day. If the tractor is your conscience but not been in operation because of other activities then it will slowly cease to function. The tractor is anchored to the bank with a quick release clip so as to enable it to be unhitched with ease each day to drive into the sea and face the day? Then when the tide goes out again you simply reverse yourself back up onto the bank and rest until tomorrow till the new day begins and start all over again? But why is your tractor submerged? Again, if the tractor is your conscience it may well be you have neglected to come out and face some of your new days thus leaving your tractor anchored in the one place on the beach? It’s possible that the forces of nature of life itself have altered the mean level of the normal level of your tidal activity thereby flooding your tractor when not in use? When the tractor is in daily use we can be aware of the rising tide each day and make the appropriate adjustments of how far back you need to park it so that it doesn’t submerge when you awake ready for a new day? Having been neglected for some time (time passed) perhaps living in the past the tide has simply crept up on you because as you say yourself you’ve been “sleeping a lot lately) This sleeping may be a distraction causing you to miss the daily tides? The tractor needs to be above sea level not under it. You need it to sort through your daily life and of a night when the tide goes out your sub conscience will continue to assist you as you sleep? You can’t have the tractor submerged.This has happened before but you’ve seen what other people have done when this happens, they (perhaps your maintenance crew simply go in and perhaps give your tractor an overhaul so it can get started again. This may be seen as a wake up call to wake you up a bit? Once the machine has been serviced and running again it’s time for you to reverse it back to saftey up on the new tidal mark on the bank and as a safety precaution you might anchor it off until tomorrow comes when it is nice and rested waiting for the new and rising tide of the new day? This must be repeated daily. Once you miss a few tides you are then in danger of being submerged again.\r\nThe distraction that caused you to allow the Tractor to get submerged: Just a guess here but it’s possible that you’ve been spending a lot of time on your “dream life” the place is “idyllic” that is it seems perfect for you away from the daily rough and tumble of the sea? The place itself is in the countryside with a small building housing various crafts and pottery and it’s nice and sunny convenient to assist with the pottery? Here we possibly see the other end of your spectrum? On one hand the daily tides of life with the big decisions you need to make each day just to get through then on the other hand an ideal place in the country where you can sleep to your hearts content and be creative with your crafts and pottery in the sunny countryside. This setting is idyllic and well suited to you because the crafts relax you and you must feel at peace with yourself in this ideal setting (no big tractor here no big decisions) this idyllic place is so peaceful for you that it has caused you to sleep too much, loosing time away from the real world possibly because you may need a certain amount of rest in your life.\r\nThe plastic clip: This is a quick release mechanism designed to be secured and unsecured with ease. The original old tractors had their implements bolted on and it was hard going to change them so they just left them on rendering the use of the tractor to only one job. Then came the 3 point Linkage set up, then what is called the quick hitch set up which allowed the operator to change the function of the tractor very quickly making it a more versatile peice of equipment all because of the quick hitch system. So to we see your quick hitch system in the plastic clip? I’m still trying to figure this out but even as you yourself have noticed that the plastic clip and piece of string is far too feeble to hold back the big tractor? I’m just wondering about the crafts and pottery, what they represent to you? This idyllic project seems to have the effect of at least trying to anchor your tractor from moving sometimes? Your distraction may be seen as in the string as your attachment to your crafts using it to anchor your conscience to save it from entering the new day and making the decisions needed to get through the day in other words it gives the conscience a break, a rest. Even though the tractor is very powerful and provides all the traction we need to get through each day it still needs to be used, it cannot be neglected. The plastic clip and piece of string may be your connection to your very relaxing crafts and pottery and as we realise is not strong enough to stop the tractor from becoming submerged should the rising tide come in higher than the average? It does provide great traction for life only when it is in operation each day? It’s possible your dream is showing you about balance by showing you how easy it is to disengage from one part of your life so that you don’t suffer loss in another part of your life??? If this is so then your dream is asking you to keep and eye on the daily tides and be prepared for them each day when they come in. Also not to over indulge in the idyllic sunny countryside when you get too much relaxation and fall asleep??? Eves comments on the wetsuit to keep you from getting too much of a shock when you decide to “ dive in” and retrieve your tractor are great.\r\nThe clip and the string: The string may represent your tie to crafts and art and is seen as your attempt to create a relaxing connection to anchor the tractor. The plastic quick release although manufactured from natural products has undergone a lot of change just like the new and modern quick hitch system for the tractor. This modern and clever little clip allows you to quickly change your needed connection to be appropriately involved in the changing rhythm of your days. The tractor can be used for many purposes when it connects the right implements. Your little plastic clip cannot always hold the tractor back. It’s designed to unclip as well but when the time is right quickly and effortlessly clip back up again. [END]"}

I was hanging with my brother, (prior to this part of my dream I was doing something but I can’t remember what I was doing.)we where In his van and I STARTED TELLING HIM ABOUT MY DREAM… from when before I woke at 5AM so crazy! Then I went on to someone breaking into my car and she stole my stuff, she was homeless and with other people but also lives in a sober house. She gave me back one pair of shoes and I finally got the other one from her after threatening her. I took the box home and they where diff shoes. I took them back to her and freaked out on her yelling. Her and her friends started looking for the shoe. It was taking forever; she got in my face and I told her to get out of my face or I would fight her. She didn’t so I punched her but it was a slow punch, I hit her face where her glasses where and didn’t think it hurt her but she said OWE and started crying. We where all of a sudden in her sober house and I was talking a bunch of smack to her and her friends calling them low life’s. Then I told them to go get a drug and alcohol assessment and I helped them with resources the girl that needed to find my shoe left to find my shoe in a golf cart full of her stuff. So I asked her roommate where her other stuff was and she showed me bexause I was going to take some of her stuff as collateral until she got me my shoe. But it was all baby stuff and I didn’t wanna take her baby stuff. All of a sudden I was on the roof my mom was there and someone else idk who and I thought I was to fat for the roof and I was going to break it. Then all of a sudden it was not my real mom but it was my street mom and she was nice and helped me and showed me where the girls food was. I messed up her cupboards and took some of her food. (I have clients in real life for my job) one of my clients I haven’t heard from was in my dream and I told her you neeed to call me you are not in compliance and she shut the door on me. I was irritated but I left and remember thinking in my dream about daily stuff it’s wierd.

Outside you are concerned about a potential explosion about to happen and as you attempt to flee the impending danger you notice on the inside the putrid slimy worm stuck to the ceiling. By contrast There is imminent danger outside and imminent danger inside. Outside is not safe, inside is not safe. The fly you mention is not only feeding on poop but also laying it’s eggs on the organic matter. The fly and the poop of course is most unbecoming for you so you try to scare, frighten it of with only rocks and shouting which of course only unsettles it’s feeding/egg laying which off course infuriates this dragon worm.

This tower has continually been outgrown by new buildings and in your dream in danger Of a bomb to explode it. The bomb may represent the explosion of higher towers surrounding it making it in danger of not being able to utilize its communication antennae?

Your building by comparison is in danger of being outgrown or rather ingrown with your dragon worm breeding itself within your tower threatening to make you also obsolete. You see and understand the impending doom confronting the CN Tower outside facing the explosion of surrounding growth and now you are beginning to understand the imminent danger of the breeding dragon worms within your building. Your dragon worm has already grown to the point that your normal tactics of hurling small hurling small stones aren’t really working anymore frightening it by shouting also proves ineffective? Now you are forced to go one better, the knife with a keen cutting edge perhaps the tongue is used to slice strips off your Dragon worm. You barre entry to your late fathers house knowing perhaps that you don’t stand a chance if the 2 were to team up against you. Her we see a war of words and arguments your tongue etc used as a knife and you holding your knife under your fathers chin and when you succeed to make the cut all the bad blood between you both are exposed and you are covered in the slag drowning in it. You yourself speak of a confrontation and this seems true but now we see details of bad blood between the 2 of you the small rocks the shouting the piecing knife like tongue. This dragon is dead but it lives in filth somewhere in your soul. You mention the dark memories, memories which attempt to revive the dragon and stir up the old arguments. Not only did you fight with your father but you say yourself that it’s also difficult to take on his mantle which is a problem in addition to the bad blood between the 2 of you. Notice the CN building how it’s communication was outgrown by taller buildings so your communication in danger of exploding as the dragon kept getting bigger and bigger and now beginning to fester.

Perhaps, I would say there is a thread here of joining things conceptually that might be usually separate distinct ideas. Sometimes over compartmentalization can get in the way of the unconscious. If this is the case it could be a sign to find connecting threads between over compartmentalized ideas. [END]"}

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was walking through medieval cellars that were continually getting tighter, in one instance I even had to squeeze through. on the floors, there laid a number of turtles, some on their back, some about to fall, and some just lying normally. Their heads were scaly, some reminiscent of a dragon. When I got out of the cellar I found myself on a town square. It was evening, lights dim with some shadows flying around. Only one shadow was dense and round. It wore a blue and white jacket with a masquerade mask. I provocatively yelled at it \"Hey death!\" It noticed me and started slowly and ominously chasing me. Suddenly, a girl clad in a celebratory village dress. She said that \"It´s starting\" and took me inside of a room that was connected with the town square. A great iron gate with bars was closed behind me. More girls who had the same dress were inside. Clergymen started a prayer, yet I did not know the words. I felt ashamed, anxious, and the shadow was staring at me hauntingly. Then a dance started, I did not know the moves, I was being pushed around, I even pushed off a glass that broke. Everyone was dancing on the glass shards and clothes that looked like mine that weren't there before. The Clergymen were watching me disapprovingly. The women did not care, they were happy that I was trying to dance with them. After the dance, I started picking up the shards and cut myself accidentally. My blood was not dense, and it was watery. After the cut, my father called me and asked me how I was. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: I woke up cold and anxious ###","completion":" This is one of those dreams that sound amazing for Jungian interpretation - so full of symbols. There is a very classic interpretation by Jung (one of his own dreams if I remember correctly) where he interpreted a house in a dream as an image if the mind. The basement is the subconscious. Deep beneath the house is the collective unconscious, where dragons and monsters dwell. These are the complexes of the collective unconscious, the things that you need to face in order to mature as a human being. Tod Venn mentions the dragons and Shadow above. The village and traditional clothing also sounds as relating to the collective subconscious. I think Peterson would say that this relates to drives that are collective to us as humans, and sometimes older that Homo Sapiens. There is a conflict here between the feminine (the women) and a religious and/or patriarchal authority (clergy, your father). There appears to be a situation that is out of your control; the dancing on broken glass, closed gates, you are pushed around and don't know the moves. Maybe some kind of ecstatic feeling of being out of control. Maybe you need to learn to let go? There is also a conflict here; on the one hand you are trying to dance, on the other hand the clergy and your father are disapproving of you. You may want to contemplate this in relation to your relationship to your father. This may either refer to your actual father or be a symbol of a hierarchical way of thinking, especially as relating to religion and spirituality (considering the clergy). The part about the blood is also interesting, and I would advise you to contemplate it rather that try to give you an answer. My spontaneous associations are that blood is thicker than water, and also the passage in the Gospels where a Roman sticks a spear into the side of the crucified Christ, and both blood and water comes out (a scene which is closely related to baptism and the Mass), but these are my associations, not yours.

The natural tendency for us to repress aspects of our behavior interests me, and is obviously a function of the unconscious, like not allowing ourselves to be aggressive and let off steam, which can cause us to eventually explode like a pressure cooker etc. I wonder whether the violent behavior of the masculine symbol was so intolerable to you it made you act violently too. I wonder whether this is about the way you judge against the naturally repressed aspects of your own personality which have value, which the unconscious projects onto the masculine symbol here. Given the thug, this dream may relate to the initial stage of Animus integration, and given that you were involved in the killing of him, may speak to how you judge against and repress what he represented, in yourself. The killing may also imply a transition from the first stage, to the second stage of the development of your Animus. In the second stage the Animus, the symbolically masculine aspect of the female's personality is associated with forward planning, among other things, as you were in this dream. [END]"}

The way they end up dying is that Chucky (you know, the creepy doll) runs around underneath the platform with his hand out, grabbing the kid’s hands, and if the kid squeezes his hand back then he sentences them to death by chasing after them with a huge knife.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was at some kind of archeological dig. The man leading the dig had a daughter, a beautiful woman about my age, and after playing hard to get, she decided she really liked me. Later in the dream, I met another beautiful woman, also my age, who also really liked me. This made the situation difficult, since I had to decide which one to hurt. It wasn't a pleasant choice. In the end, I chose the second woman.  Now, I associate these women with my anima. What does anyone here think about this? Does this indicate some kind of \"split?\" Another detail is that the first woman had dark hair, and the second woman had light hair.

The archeologist is your introspective behavior. In my view that’s a good thing. Both the girls in my view are ways you see romance. They are sequential, and in my view the dream advises that your taste in women will change and that both paths lead to an injury in you. The well scene Id say is premonition. Its the well or reservoir of the collective unconscious... a premonition possibly to you posting on this site. The chunk of ice is the non growing you... meaning you choose the first girl or first version of you, the unfrozen water becomes the second version of you as it is brought to light. That is the more integrated growing version of you. The world is a cold place, but you find warmth in yourself as you become wise or resonate with the light. I use light as a metaphor in the spiritual sense. I don’t think it has anything to do with the actual girl, other than sparking your introspection. I think it has everything to do with how the girl will change through your perspective should you choose to either change or not. Or put another way. You are a lense that might dig more or not. The outcome is the same either way.. something is gained and something is lost. Same principle applies to you. If you wish to grow the previous you will die. Hope that makes sense. Either path you choose... make sure to involve the actual girl in this journey. Its a dream that is loaded with spiritual growth symbols. If she responds well then great, if not then... sadly same scenario. Something is gained and something is lost. But you will be warm in the cold, so do not fear it. [END]"}

I’d say you aren’t relating well to your instincts at this time. The shadow you saw was the shadow archetype which pops up when the ego is too one sided. This creates a shadow in the unconscious that blocks the relating factor (the animus) from reaching consciousness. The dog is also the animus. It’s appearance at the end of the dream is a positive sign since the animus when it appears as an animal indicates the disconnect from your instincts. If an animal shows up like a poisonous snake it generally means you are dangerously out of touch with instinct. The fact that your dog showed up and was pleasant to you is a sign you are better connected to your animus and so better at relating to your inner instincts and the outer world. Perhaps you have been wondering about the partner you are getting engaged to and I’d hazard a guess (obviously I don’t know either of you) but that perhaps you should trust your instincts about him. Look at him in a balanced way. See both positives and negatives. When you balance your perception of your partner you will get a clearer hit on your instincts. Sounds like by the end of the dream your better connected to your animus. This occurs when we confront the shadow... [END]"}
{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was standing in my pops house that no longer stands and I was in the lounge room and there were pigeons, heaps of them, sitting on top of some ledge near the ceiling. I was sort of walking around and I saw my mum and then one of my brothers. Next moment all the pigeons flew away but all I saw was this white poop everywhere, on the curtains and walls. My dad came into the scene and I said to him I will clean this up some how. In my head I was trying to work out the safest way to clean it up. I Thought if I take down the curtains first and wash them, as I thought of this and imagined it I saw the windows exposed which then made it easier to see the mess on the walls. I didn’t feel any negativity in the dream. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" The house symbolizes your mind, and the people in it are your inner energies (our energy is on a spectrum with two ends - Masculine and Feminine). You say you spoke only to your father as he arrived at the scene when you saw the mess. You spoke about cleaning up the place. This to me indicates that you are using your power of discernment and action to engage in shadow-work. Shadow-work is about facing our shadows and cleaning up our psychological anchorages. It requires focus, courage, will power, determination, and discernment. These are all aspects of the Masculine side of the energy spectrum. The Father indicated that you'd be falling back on your learned Masculine ways to engage in this work. The Feminine side is about openness, acceptance, tolerance, patience etc. That remained in the background in your dream along with the young Masculine. You're engaging a specific section of your mind to do this inner work. The pigeons may symbolize your natural self, the unconditioned self trying to shine through your conditioned self. Excrement of any form in dreams is usually symbolic of creativity so your dream would imply you have immense potential waiting to be unleashed, which without active channeling has led to a scattered mess within. Perhaps the element of shyness or conditioning of \"right and wrong\" is playing a part in you stifling some aspects of yourself. You remove the \"curtains\" to clean them. That's symbolic of voluntarily uncovering the deeper wounds, the deeper self, and also symbolic of being open to Light (to enlightenment, to self-awareness) by willingly uncovering the access to your own Self. As there was more Light, you did see more of what you needed to \"clean\". This naturally happens when we go down this path of actively engaging in our spiritual ascension through shadow-work. More and more comes to light that needs to be transmuted. In each moment in life, we deal with the issue at hand to the best of our knowledge, capacity, and intentions at that given point. This may lead to discovering things that would leave us feeling demotivated, but our Masculine energies of persistence and courage always come in handy. The dream was interrupted, but I believe it has conveyed to you the message it carried. You're subconsciously growing into a new person because the global environment has been changing drastically, yet on some levels imperceptibly. The same dynamic is being reflected in all individuals based on our unique circumstances. Depending on how your life may have been changing (I didn't see an indication of turbulence, just natural smooth ascension and growth), the dream indicates that you're actively finding ways to express your true self in spite of how things may appear initially.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was at some kind of ceremony that I had a good amount of contempt for. We were very shoddily acting out a re-enactment of something. I remember having a vague idea of what I was supposed to be doing, but everything was screwed up. My contribution was the furthest off from the ideal, but it everyone else seemed content with the proceedings. Something significant was supposed to happen in the ceremony but a car crash or another kind of emergency outside made everyone focus on that instead. However, while everyone was busying themselves with that I noticed a small, almost imperceptible scratch on my the end of my ring finger (I cant remember which hand). I started to squeeze it and puss started to come out. It wasn't painful, in fact it was pretty relieving to have it come out. It was kind of off-white or greenish initially, but as I kept squeezing it, eventually it turned into red, kind of like clotted blood. It didn't take long before I got all of the hardened stuff out of my finger and I as I did so I had garnered a fair amount of \"eww\"s and \"yuck\"s and \"doesnt that hurt?\" To which I responded \"not really. My body needs to get rid of it.\" Having felt I got it all out I looked up again and everything seemed different. The ceremony was apparently forgotten and no one was focused on it anymore. After a little bit of my time my focus went back to my finger where I started to work at it again. I remember feeling like I had got it all out but something was telling me it wasn't resolved.

In that regard I think you can acertain that the work to be done can only be done by you. The worm is linear and is symbolic if something that has been subconsciously eating away at you for some linear time. [END]"}

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was about to be arrested and convicted for unintentionally killing 21 people. I may have been getting ready to turn myself in, or maybe I just knew I was going to be taken in. I was talking to my mother about it, and it seems no one else was present at the time of this vivid and clearly remembered part. I was saying \"I killed 21 people. 21 People! Even if it was an accident, don't you think I should pay?!?! I should go in for negligence or SOMETHING!\" And my mother was just looking at me like she was worked up but didn't know what to say. I got the feeling that she was thinking I shouldn't be punished, that I should find a way out of it, and I was making my case that my mistake should be punished. I awoke feeling appalled and guilty, but strong and determined and posessed by truth as well. ;  Background_Info: I am not a doctor or anything like that, and nor is my mother.

I myself am much less confrontational, but any wrongs I commit tend to eat me alive. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" 21 seems significant. I see 21 as a name or description of you. Concerning the use of a number in reference to a name I quickly think of James Bond 007. Or the series “get smart” I think their numbers were 99 and 86. Some times the lady 86 would refer to 99 as Max. But when it was more serious she changed to his number, 99 same as James Bond, he was called James by his female counterparts but 007 referred to his special self. In a similar way your dream is referring to you as 21. To you 21 is significant and also represents a time of growing in your life. Now that you’re 30 you look back at yourself as 21 and realize that time could have been better and needed to be changed, in real life you do set out to change from 21 to 30. Your dream conveys this to you as stopping that life and bringing it all to an end “I dreamed that I was about to be arrested and convicted” Normally after growing through to adult hood we would move on to the next stage of our life but in your case 21 needs to go before you can move on. For this to happen you need to be arrested that is in some way taken in to custody.. pulled up in some way and then having been pulled up then convicted about 21 and what it means to you. Once you’ve been “convicted” in your heart you can get on with it to a new start in life. You sort of know you need to do something because you say to yourself “I may have been getting ready to turn myself in” so there is thought and preparation involved about what you see as 21. You don’t really want to kill 21 because that’s who you are and neither does your mother. However you realize that you need to kill 21 because now you have a conviction in your heart that 21 needs to go so that you don’t need to be in this position at 30. You say you were in a position of “unintentionally” killing 21 people. Perhaps you were happy to continue your life as 21 until you were arrested and convicted in your heart that 21 needs to die/go. This is very similar to the language of God, because that’s exactly what the holy spiritual does he arrests us that is stop us from continuing on in a harmful way then having stopped us then works in our heart to convict us that we are wrong.

The guy can be representing something you did (you asking him \"what did you do?\" ) and so the interior of the apartment is a reflection of how you feel about whatever that was. Hence you feel you are kind of a mess and the feral cats might be some cattiness that felt out of control or unlike you. Cats can also represent female sexuality, introversion or intuition among other things. The fact they are feral in the dream suggests you were judging yourself for not attending to them and letting your more animalistic urges run free. Basically, I think you woke up with anxiety because there was some situation in your life that you think you should have behaved differently but we are often our harshest critics so perhaps the dream is indicating to give yourself the compassion/ help you thought you should show the guy in the dream.

Yard sale would indicate some sentiment around old stuff/no longer serving/but also letting go as people are usually doing it when decluttering/ moving on.

All my family, brother, mom, dad, grandpa and grandpa, aunts etc was sitting around a table, eating dinner. Then I “woke up”, and I was all alone by the table. So I woke up from a dream, in my dream. And I started crying and looking for my family, and I said over and over “it’s too much, I can’t take this anymore”. ;  Background_Info:  I have had so many sad dreams for about a year. Crying and screaming in my sleep, + it freaks my bf out. My dad committed suicide 12 years ago, I was 11 at the time. I had a tough time dealing with it for many years, but I’ve been working on letting go and move on for about 3 years. The dreams are very different, but it’s always the same pattern: my dad comes back for a day, week, month, and he totally ignores me. I try to talk to him but he just pushed me away and talk to everyone else.

You felt \"he is gone! He is not here!\" And the pain of that was first and foremost. Now that you are processing the grief, you are moving back to the feeling of his presence, and the joy and comfort that you felt being together with him, the love he had for you. You always had the joy, love and comfort there too, underneath the pain of loss, but couldn't access it. Now you can open and access this joy again, because the grief is not making you turn away from the happiness that is there. Of course this is a scary process - opening to feeling comfort, joy, love, security, happiness, this is a reminder of how that good feeling is something that can be taken away. Which is frightening. And causes inner conflict \"maybe I shouldn't feel the joy, because then it will hurt more if I lose that feeling\". The dream is telling you, \"you never lost that feeling, it has always been there and it always will be there. The joy is bigger than the grief. The pain turned you away from the joy, the joy never left\" It is saying that your father, in this way, and also in how you are very much like him in many good ways, your father has never left you. Instead of feeling his absence, you are feeling his presence, as you open up to the positive attachment you felt with him, and as you open up to the side of yourself that is very much like your father. In the dreams, the contrast of being alone and being with family is a reminder that you are never truly alone when you have loved and been loved. For all those you connect with in life, you live in their hearts, as they live in yours. In this way, there is a life beyond death, time, and place. [END]"}

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I'm driving a car in a world I am familiar with, it's a video game world, more specifically the Grand Theft Auto world. (I’ve never really played the game by the way, IF I played it, my time was spent driving around legally, not even speeding. So it’s safe to say I haven’t really played it) I realize the cops are chasing me, no small amount of cops, cars and policemen on foot. I'm an evil man (woman in real life btw which is interesting as well), a criminal. I drive fast and recklessly and I’m running through several doors, up and down stairs….Soon I've gotten rid of the cops, they're not after me anymore. I'm in an empty house that’s still being built, it’s basically still just an iron structure (similar to the one in The Dark Knight when Batman and Joker battle)…I'm not alone, Aragorn (Lord of the Rings) is there fighting me and he has a sword, I also have a sword. We are hanging on iron pillars and fencing. I get a hold of his sword and I kick him off the building, I watch him fall while I hang there.

I loved the Joker 2020 movie. ;  Wakeup_State: I wake up and I do not want to fall asleep again, I escaped, I won, but I'm evil. ###","completion":" You are not the villain! However your dream is simply giving you a view of what might be going on within you at this time. You say it’s a nightmare for you and right from the start we understand that your dream is giving you a glimpse into what you normally wouldn’t perceive since the suggestion is this part of your life is in darkness but what is now revealed by your dream at first seems frightening simply because you previously could not see/perceive it. Before we start it would be helpful to understand from my perspective that we all experience inner conflict.  Look at this, another law, another way, waging war against you waging war against your mind with the purpose of taking you captive. This happens to us all through temptation to various things which we should know better. Looking at your dream again we see your villain is running away from the heroes, he’s been caught out now whereas before he/she was lurking in the unseen darkness gently deceiving you at first but now your dream has exposed the villain within and he’s on the run, he wants to hide from all this light you are subjecting him to, but he can’t because you’ve reached a point where you are determined to chase down this villain. So on one hand your villain is become exposed on the other hand you are not comfortable at realizing there is actually a villain lurking within whose purpose is to bring you into captivity and steal your vehicle. Now you realize that you must actively engage to take this villain into your captivity, reign him in!  The car here is probably your outward every Day body/vehicle and you are a driven type of person seems obvious. You have the drive to go forward in your immediate world whatever that is eg business/ sports whatever? You are driven! In your dream your world identifies with grand theft auto? From memory elite vehicles have been shopped and stolen for a specific customer who really likes and want that style of vehicle, they are willing to pay for it. Here’s the thing, it does seem like you are an elite person of sorts your vehicle holds a special place of interest designed to move fast in the company of elite vehicles similar to yourself. You have perfected the design and you are now sought after by others within your familiar life. But now we see the villain entering in to steal away your vehicle just like in grand theft auto where the owner has perfected his ability to design his life the way he wants and make his vehicle streamlined to suit his own particular purpose only to find to his dismay the villain the thief who has done no such work but simply comes along to steal your car, your streamlined vehicle that was designed by you to suit a specific purpose. So now we can see you as the hero and the villain, the hero as one who puts in all the design work and produces a streamlined vehicle and you also as the villain want into to steal the car away simply to sell it to the highest bidder (grand theft auto) You are perhaps young and don’t understand this concept, your streamlined vehicle was made that way by vigilant had work according to the law of your mind. The villain is the thief who see’s the beautiful vehicle and has done nothing to make it great and elite and simply steals it from you. So far your dream is showing you to take good care of the vehicle you have produced because the thief is always looking to steal it from you. You are not the thief as you so describe yourself “ you do not normally speed etc because you are a careful and thoughtful and you don’t break the law you are not not reckless with your vehicle, each of us need to at some time need to contend. with this situation because we are so given to conditioning ourselves we don’t notice other thoughts creeping in, and this I bother thief creeps into your life, while you are busy conditioning yourself you don’t notice him gradually sneaking in. By stealing your vehicle (GTA) he will only destroy what you have created. Here we see your villain warring against your good mind trying to derail you and eventually sell your vehicle for gain rather than use it for what you originally designed it for.\r\nYour villain now realises the cops (your conscience) are chasing him up, that’s why he’s running, he’s a thief and he’s stealing your vehicle and as all good cars have an anti theft device so too does your conscience alert you to the attempted theft of your streamlined vehicle.you understand a criminal act is in progress you are alerted by your cops, police etc friends groups etc something is not right something criminal is taking place?\r\nYou are not a criminal you are not reckless but now the criminal within you must remember does not live by the same laws as you live by, remember he is lurking in the darkness and warring against your good mind and he’s waiting for an opportunity to steal your good work.\r\nYour villain is criminally minded that is he breaks all the good laws that you abide by. He manages to elude you through doors and up and down stairs.. perhaps the doors he runs to escape are doors you unwitting opened and now he is using them to escape from you.the stairs you climbed the highs and the lows you’ve battled through he is now using them to his advantage.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I am in an underground activity, like an escape room but on a larger scale, like a labyrinth. There are lots of people walking around trying to find the way out, but getting nowhere. One of them is an old dancing partner when I was taking ballroom dancing lessons. I get the impression of a long time searching for the proper path. The focus of the dream is when I come to an old temple, Ancient Greek-ish with a large granite statue, specifically granite with a rustic pinkish hue. Looking up into the temple roof I realise no one is up there and it dawns on me that the path is likely up there as no one down here has found the way, so I head up there. The dream then goes to an out of body view of the path. There is an above ground bridge like structure, and the way corkscrews as a tunnel around it. Because its a tunnel everyone assumes its underground, but it isn't, its not logical. That's the trick. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" The subconscious here in the subterranean can mean both the shadow or unexplored self, which turns into impulse if we are not aware of it, and also the subsistence level mindset or even a survivalist mindset, where we react to life instead of choosing things in life. This happens if we have a bunch of unresolved issues or trauma that bogs us down, and we find ourselves defensive or triggered often by daily occurances, we cannot respond to these with openness or full responsiveness, because we have shut ourselves down due to the fight, flight or freeze reaction. (I more and more think that the key to unconscious/ consciousness exploration is linked with the parasympathetic nervous system response. And that neuroscience is finding out what religion has said for a long time - that love is consciousness, the higher path, awareness.... it is only when we feel the safety of being loved that we can actually open our awareness with our higher faculties). And so many are stuck in this trap. Or puzzle or maze like an escape room. It is like a trap, because interestingly, we cannot truly figure out this unconscious reactivity this defensive triggered survival mode while we are actually in it. Neuroscience is saying this too. That you feel safe again first. THEN look at understanding the trigger. But first, get out of the hole you are in, to see from a wider perspective. Often, we get trapped in the survivalist mode because we try to figure it out from within that survivalist mode. For example, someone who feels triggered by another’s behavior might then identify that behavior as the cause of the trigger. But this doesn't actually go very far in understanding, overcoming, or resolution. It merely cements the knowledge that the world is unsafe and that we have to have our defenses up instead of trying to find common ground. The tunnels I think are a metaphor similar to the \"trances\" they often talk about in the new age (and sometimes psychology). The auto pilot mode, that is living unconsciously, without conscious awareness and choice making. \"Tunnel vision\" is seeing only the narrowest path in front of you and no way out. This can be like depression \"a long dark tunnel\". Tunneling into something also in a more positive way can be about obsessive focus on figuring out the originating path of some particular behavioral pattern. Sometimes I think we do have to delve deeply into an obsessive thought on a specific topic in order to understand that pattern in our life. But, as in your dream, the idea is to recall you are not just in a negative obsessive circular thought pattern. But that instead you are \"tunneling\" up and out, in order to find the secret way to unlock this particular unconscious behavioral pattern, to crack the code, to be able to stop unconsciously repeating it.

Is the water clear? Fiance might be the dedication to this idea or part of you that lies in the coffin. Is it dead? Or a possibility to raise this from the dead, child sometimes means regression into something but it seems the \"movement\" into regression is missing. Did you felt that this fiance of your dreams was really your fiance? Some idea you want to put into rest in connection to her? Maybe even an important idea or possibility put into rest for now. Maybe its something you \"ought\" to be, or you think you have to be in front of the world and others (as its the part of the building that is on top thus most visible to others). You even say public but yours, or your view is out there but you have two? Since you descend down I think you find more of you really, the building naturally might stand as metaphor of you or so Venus there actually points to some future or underlying motivation/ desire which is represented on top with the choices via latters. Water is quite often sacred and a symbol of life and creativity, so this all kind of points that maybe you are at a crossroads making a decision? [END]"}

It reminds me very much of Discord where there was so many different levels and areas that people could explore, learn and work their way through. If they could, I got lost in it. The ballroom dancing lessons are interesting because it doesn’t go with the rest of the dream. Therefore I linked it up with another room within the escape room structure. This room is filled with a ball or balls, another room and maybe the main room in your dream to challenge you. This could be you wanting to face some goals to allow you to become more connected with yourself. To dance with someone you need to be in tune with them, so this could be looking at the connection you have with yourself. The connection is also needed in working out and understanding each room, each of different levels of thinking, to move you forward to where you want to be or do. The temple is the focus of the dream, so to me this is showing where your energy and excitement is at the foremost part of your thinking. This is an old temple though and this makes me think you are using your experiences along previous passage ways to allow you to visit a new challenge which you haven’t invested any energy before.

I guess from a Jungian perspective the girl/s could be seen as your anima symbols, and the dark underground perhaps your deep unconscious. The surprise assassin is an interesting twist. I love how dreams, though supposedly coming from our own minds, can spin a story and lead us to a point without us suspecting what's about to happen, then surprise us! It's like they don't come from our self at all. If characters in dreams should be aspects of ourselves, then if the underground is the unconscious, the assassin motif leads me to consider a repellent/ repressed type behavior. A 'friend' being someone that they are related to, a repressed aspect of ourselves sure, symbolized as someone dormant, sleeping. I guess what you said at the start, that the people below ground, 'we were there to defend ourselves'. That too sounds like the way people judge against/ repress certain traits, as when people try to repress an aggressive side to survive in polite society. [END]"}

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: The dream was that a significantly older man was chasing after me and wanted to perform unwanted sexual acts on me. It was quite disturbing. On Friday night though, as I was running away, I moved into another dream where I was running down a stone cavernous hallway. I'm running away from something but I'm not sure what. I keep coming to wooden doors with ironwork designs on them and unlocking them with my old fashioned, black iron key. From around the right corner, before I run to each door, there is a woman with dark hair and eyes in a pink dress towing a mule on a rope. She walks around the corner before I run down the hallway where each door is so I see her 3 or 4 times as if I'm running down the same hallways again 4 times. I never look to see if she is coming from somewhere so I don't know if there is actually a corridor she's coming from. Eventually, I run through one of the doors and there was a white field. I hear a voice behind me and it's a futuristic-looking boy of about 18 (picture cyberpunk goggles and dystopian future-looking clothing). He says something and before I can hear it, I realize I'm dreaming, wake up and I ask him, \"What are you doing here? Who are you? Why am I having this dream and what and I supposed to learn?\" He smiles coyly and says I can only learn that if I promise I'm still dreaming. I say yes and he leads me back around to where I previously saw the next wooden door in the fully white field, but now there is cobblestone and an old town. I've been here before but only during summer when he place looked like a mystical campground. Now it looks dark, cold and snowy. All the people are silhouettes and faceless. The boy leads me around the block and speaks but I can't really hear him. I'm more focused on the silhouette people (if you've seen inception, the people moved in a similar way except they were only shadows). There was also nobody in the houses. As we round the second last corner of the block, I tell the boy I changed my mind and that I want to go through the wooden door instead. He asks if I'm sure and when I say yes, I suddenly become quite cartoonish and dive through the wooden door like a superhero. My brother and I not fly through space as I chose the video game as if we are at a starting screen. I choose a game called SMASH and play as a miniature gorilla with veins all over its body except this character is MY body in the same way that Ready Player One works. I win enough fights that I get chosen as a champion for the last round where I fight against a blue zombie girl who rips my nervous system out of my body with her tongue and my fiance catches me and tells me it's okay and that my real-life body won't be affected, but I was terrified I would be horribly injured in real life. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" The dream is very much like the tale of blue beard.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was at a beach, and there was an odd looking vehicle a bit like a tractor with its large back wheels, except this vehicle had no visible wheels at the front, and even larger rear wheels. I was aware that it was once above the sea level, on the sandy banks of the beach, but time had passed and I then witnessed it submerged just below the surface of the sea. I saw some people disappear below the water level and apparently get into the cabin, when it then rapidly, with unusual speed power and ease, reversed out of where it was submerged sunken in the sand offshore, back up onto the high sandy banks of the beach. Then this event was set back in time, ready to replay again, only with myself as an active participant in it, needing to prepare to do what I'd seen the people do - get into the cabin, and get the vehicle back out the sea onto the steep, sandy banks of the beach. There were a couple of odd scenes that were never seen or featured when I witnessed the first overview of events initially, I had a one half of a plastic clip like that found on a backpack or luggage (pictured), partly broken, which was presumably attached to the vehicle at one end, that I connected to the other half of the clip presumably attached to the sandy bank, one of the actual plastic clips was broken but I connected it to the other half precariously. I recall mentioning how seemingly ridiculous this feeble link was for the job at hand. Then, equally absurdly, I was handling some thin string which again might've been attached to the clip, which I was threading onto something fixed on the bank on the beach. Then was a sense of time urgency, and I along with a few others were standing atop the steep sandy banks of the beach, preparing to head to the sunken vehicle, submerge ourselves in the cold ocean and enter the cabin before getting the vehicle out from beneath the sea, where it was stuck deep into the sand, submerged. We were putting on wetsuits. I asked another \"do I need to take my top off?\" before putting on the wetsuit, \"yes\". Putting my arm into the sleeve of the suit I noticed just how thick the material was, several inches thick, enough to keep me from being shocked from the cold ocean temperature, so thick I might not even notice the temperature change at all. ;  Background_Info: I had this dream after I'd already woken once, my sleeping pattern has been terrible this last year.

Therefore, it’s quite possible that because of the larger setting, environment of a big fancy house party and future, you dreamed of perhaps even a thought of living a different life than hers (including yours perhaps at the moment). She could be spiritually messaging you through the afterlife (dream medium) to tell you to take risks. This is similar to how she told you a permanent goodbye in the dream setting, yet you still saw her land safely on someone else and continue on? So basically, she’s telling you that goodbyes aren’t forever if you love someone, and to take advantages of opportunities while you can as ‘risks.’ By connecting logic with your subconscious, you are correct because you cannot just imagine something NEW or create something that you have not seen details of before. You are 100% in the acceptance & reflection stage of loss or life in general, thereby you have let go of her control/ influence, however you still love her and value her opinion.

Dying upon entering this holy place could mean the old you dying in order to be reborn, entering a higher place.

It appears that either myself, or the older man, looks exactly like Jordan Peterson and is a psychologist. We are fully dressed but laying on a double bed.

The man almost immediately realize that I now know. He gets up and escape. I knock out the older woman by banging her head on the bedpost.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: Had this dream where I was at the car wash. So I could get my car washed. There was a car in front of mine. The whole thing exploded before my eyes. I pulled up and the attendent said he did not belong. He had me pop my hood, hosed the engine then had me go through. He said I'm fine and I went through. When I came out I was on a bicycle and a Ghostbuster. My first job was recruit people and bust a cave witch, her husband who is a Djinn and their children. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" Hi, I have a few suggestions. My thoughts are that the dream is about the way you are progressing with your life. You know you need to clean things up. Perhaps you have some concerns that you are headed towards a risky or volatile future in some way. And this is a future to which you know you don’t belong. The engine I feel is about your inner self and your own personal source of power. What is if that makes \"your motor run\"? What is if that gets you going in life, that gives you drive and motivation? Have lost your motivation for life? Do you need a tune up, because your dream suggests you need to clean this up too! Water can of course represent emotions and healing. Washing is a symbol of cleansing. The attendant is a part of you, the part that needs to pay attention and \"attend\" to these inner parts so you move forward with power. When you \"clean up\" this attendant part knows you will be fine. The bike suggests that you need to become more independent and to focus on your own very personal journey in life. There maybe some ghosts from your past that also need busting in order for you to do this. I feel the job you must do is to get some help and support. Who can you recruit or employ, to help you bust these ghosts? Perhaps a therapist or counselor? The cave is an ancient symbol for the inner dark caverns of our own self. The place where our shadow self hides. All the parts that we reject and repress, all the parts of our own selves that cause us trouble. Parts that have been hurt, insecurities, shame, anger etc. The witch and her husband suggest a sense of \"evil\" or badness you perhaps feel inhabits your own darkness. There is a clear family unit here too so there could be some links to you'd own family or upbringing. In my opinion this is a powerful dream that calls you to do some personal work and healing. I wish you courage in your efforts. [END]"}

Agape love, universal love, what is termed also \"christian charity\", selfless love, a larger view of self, caring for others, \"Gods love”. I think neuroscience (for example Stephen Porges polyvagal theory) is just telling us now what ancient religion and philosophy has also said. Agape love is the answer to consciousness. Giving it and receiving it opens the pathways. Pathways here also are figurative, as in changing behavioral patterns in life through increasing overview and wider awareness. But also literal - opening and strengthening new pathways in the brain to form connections that used to be dead ends or circular thought patterns before. Agape love, which I think is necessary in consciously starting a family, is linked with hope, faith, optimism, and it is definitely the guiding philosophical principle which can improve life for oneself and others.

Your mind may have been trying to tell you that you need to cut him out of your life, or let it go. The reason he may have changed to a different person in the end could be that you don't really want to hurt your brother at all, just the part of him that is doing bad and irresponsible things. That person could represent someone who has influenced or encouraged his negative behaviors in the past. I'm so sorry you had such a horrible dream.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I am sorting things on my grandmother's dining table, moving them from a cardboard box into a large trunk. Grandmother has died, and this is either my inheritance, or things that were already mine but kept in her house. My parents are packing up and sorting things in other parts of the house. When my father asks me if I am ready to leave, I ask for more time. He takes note of my short black skirt and asks if it is new. I answer that it is. All of my clothing is black, possibly because I am in mourning. He then goes off to some other part of the house to continue his sorting. I am sitting down on the floor to continue looking at the various objects, loosing myself in memories. My skirt is now a a short red kilt. I adjust my thick black stockings, pulling them up over my knees, more for warmth than anything else. One of the objects I remember is a dark wooden statue of St. Peter holding a key, which I have in fact inherited from my grandmother in waking life. It used to stand in her living room. When my father comes back a couple of hours later, he is noticeable annoyed that I am taking so much time. He is almost done sorting and packing. I tell him that I am now done and we can go. He can either drive me home, or I can take the subway. As he drives me to their house, he continues ranting about how much time I took. At the time we have reached my parents house, I have had enough and start shouting at him that he didn’t have to wait for me. He could just have gone home if he wanted, but now he has gotten more done today than expected, so he should thank me rather than complain. He now looks confused and asks me we he should be grateful to me. I wake up and my cat walks over my chest. As I fall asleep again, I am standing in front of a huge door. I am in a city together with some students. I open the door and enter into a relatively small room. The walls appear to be covered in dark red leather. I know that I am here to see the Queen. As I am waiting to be shown into the next room, I become very self-conscious about the short skirt I am wearing (a miniskirt in dark green leather), and check that it covers me from behind as well. I exit the room through a door to my right. Now I am in a museum of history, together with the students, showing them around an exhibition with black-and-white photographs. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" Interesting dream, we note the 3 different dress colors, black, red and green, also the use and mention of the word “time” and finally the wooden statue of St. Peter with the key in his hand.\r\n\r\nTHE SHORT BLACK DRESS\r\nIn your dream your grandmother has died and while reflecting on her life you are caused to reflect on your own life through your father who is also sorting and packing in the same house. As you sort through looking for your own things and perhaps anything from your grandmother and reflect on the articles your father approached you and asks you “if you are ready yet” in other words you should be ready by now because you’ve had enough time?He does manage to cause you to become self conscious when he points out that “you are wearing a new short black dress. Maybe your father represents God and tries to point out that you cannot fully respect the dead the way you are dressed baring too much skin The cardboard box is lifeless and may represent your grandmother or the religion she is connected to? The trunk is possibly you, the natural timber still alive with a larger capacity to store things. You are dressed in black for morning the death of your grandmother and take your time to absorb what she may be passing on to you? The new dress may be a new experience for you, death what does it really mean? Contained within the articles are things meant for you but to understand exactly what they are and what they mean you need “time” to reflect on the articles. But now your father wants to go and he asks you “are you ready to leave” But you are definitely not ready to leave “and ask him for more time”. At this point he notices your “short black skirt” possibly suggesting that even though you are dressed as for morning you are not that serious, but as you sort through and reflect you actually do start to become serious about it. Here we notice your “short skirt” it does at first seem respectable enough but as your father noticeably points out it’s “short” makes you more self conscious and aware especially since you are in the reflecting mode and now you start to question yourself. Your life up to now has been short and there has been no time to reflect upon it until now. Your fathers observation has pricked your conscience suggesting your behavior is irreverent. Before you never had time however the death of your grandmother affords you the necessary time you need to reflect on your short life and perhaps if you are patient and take more “time” and see if you can find some answers within your grandmothers things. The cardboard box has things you need to look at. The dinning table is a place to gather, your thoughts and share emotions and of reflect on life. This is important now and you realize by the way you are dressed your father might be right? You realize you need more “time” time to find answers and time to reflect and time to find the goodness within your grandmother. At your request your father goes off to continue packing so as to give you more “time”.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN MINI SKIRT\r\nThe 3rd skirt is in fact a “mini skirt” Green and according to Carole Heffner the Catholic meaning for the green color is of ORDINARY TIME the time between the feasts how interesting again the word “time” comes up. Let’s see where this leads us as I must admit I’m not sure where this is going yet? Your second dream now finds you standing in front of a big door in a city with some students? So we see the big/broad gate in your dream which suggests that many have entered by this way, however your group is a group of students? Students study. First we saw reflection the contemplation now actual study. The black and white pictures suggest the old history of the great church and what will your group find? To help us understand that perhaps we should look at the green mini skirt? First we see the length is not only short like the others but “mini” and this style like the others can be paired with leg-inns and also for warmth. The mini skirt is designed to bare a lot of skin and became prominent in the 1960s but what has this got to do with your group of students and the big gate? Well it seems at this period of time the mini skirt is related to the feminist movement and more a time of women’s liberation, the mini skirt also relates to the retaining of youthfulness as well as a protest against male authority. Green is the color of healing and nature. The ordinary time described by Carol of the Catholic Church a time between feasts almost says that in between these feasts there is a time when people tend to forget about Gods timetable and quickly forget and start getting involved in what they feel is more important to them. Moses experienced the same thing as he was gone longer than expected the people rose up to play they forgot about God not realizing there is still more to come. The feminist movement and the barring of there skin are acts of the flesh and because they indulge in these thing they don’t realize their TIME IS RUNNING OUT\r\n\r\nYOU SHOUT AT YOUR FATHER\r\nAfter you find the KEY your father comes back after a few hours and he is noticeably annoyed? If Your father represents God why then is he annoyed? He caused you to contemplate right? He caused you to find the KEY right? You do have the the key of life right?\r\nHe seems annoyed that you are now taking so much “Time” but this is Now the fathers time you are taking God has at great cost provided you with the Key of Life Christ his son whom religion has rejected. Of course the Father is annoyed and entitled to ask “if you are ready now” after all he has just given you the keys to the kingdom therefore it is TIME to be ready. You tell him you are done and ready to go home with him. But on the eat home you begin to argue with him. You have not recognized the father in your dream he is the one who gave you time to find the key of Peter. He’s there but you don’t see it and begin to fight with him. You give him an ultimatum declaring you can find your own way home and don’t really need him. Our father is here as the great Sheppard we are all as lost sheep and he as the great Sheppard making sure you find your way home. As you are being driven home you say he rants about how much “time” you took. The rang is probably the message of the gospel telling you that now is the time? \r\nAs you reach your parents house you shout and argue you are not listening, you had an experience but you are not aware of how he is so willing to show up in your life to help you.\r\nUnfortunately it gets worse! As he gets you home you begin a new tirade by telling him (Jesus) that he should be grateful to you! You have not noticed how patient he was with you waiting for you all this time to find the KEY to life but now you treat him badly. You make him out as miserable and impatient but in fact he has been patient and understanding and he has given you much time to sort yourself out! Your ungratefulness is even more apparent when you now tell him that he has gotten all this work done today because of you and that he should thank you for it!\r\nThis again reveals your spiritual condition yet he seems so to persevere with you after all he is your father and loves you so.\r\nYour father now looks confused and rightfully asked you why should he be grateful to you after all he is the one who died for you not you for him.\r\nThis question is designed to awaken your consciousness again but still you’re not seeing it?\r\nAs you wake up a cat walks over your chest. I don’t really know except that when a cat walks over you it wants attention but we need to realize we can’t keep walking over Christ to get his attention\r\nContinued .. [END]"}

You say you had a stable relationship and that he was sick during the last year when you gave all of yourself to him. This experience may hold some shadows of self blame, a feeling of not having done enough as is common for many people who take care of their spouses or other relations through a terminal illness. The caretakers question themselves and engage in self-criticism and self judgment. The age 24 may be implying a few things. It could be that his health started declining 4 years before he passed, it could be implying a significant experience you had at the age of 24. You have a sense of losing precious time together, there may be a fear of loneliness. Him leaving you behind is being perceived by some part of your Heart as his betrayal, but you're assuming you share the \"blame\" even as a victim of his betrayal, even in spite of all you did to help. I see these as the dreams of a Heart on the mend. Life, Death, we don't perceive much beyond the limits of our 5 senses, it doesn't mean nothing exists beyond Life and Death.

You sound like an extremely devoted, loyal, committed, and sincere partner, someone who stands with her companion and doesn't let go when they're drowning. Some part of our Heart hopes and prays that our input would yield results that would at least partly be based on our deepest desires (you'd have wanted the both of you to stay together forever).

The dream now speaks of the time “away” from your ex highlighting what each woman is going through after married life. The 2 hours being connected are most likely the same woman 2 hours of time on the same clock so to speak. By looking at how each woman handles the situation we see opposites we see conflict as they finally both meet at the same home town in the same pub which is to say both women are in each other’s lives and now they intersect giving you greater understanding about yourself. You being the first woman, the wife do what most of us would do after a marriage break up, you go home to your hometown where it’s safe and secure. From there you slowly take time out to relax and slowly start to rebuild your social life with friends at the pub.

Now you are no longer the wife she is set free to find a husband for herself. Here is your conflict because it’s at the pub where the 2 hours meet and you begin to realize and start to feel for this mistress. You have suffered by your husband but she has suffered also by being relegated to mistress. The hour of your experience has given you empathy for others and you can understand how she might be feeling having been locked out of the relationship. You now empathize with her. At first you are shocked that this woman has followed you to your home town that is the other part of you is free and starting to be exposed to you now but now you begin to understand she has nowhere else to go.

First of all water in relation to a church belong to Christ. The building is made of people understand fully that water represents cleansing and washing. holy and without blemish. Notice the church is subject to Christ! Notice the water is the word of god that is used for washing our lives. The purpose of washing is that the church will be presented to Christ as holy and beautiful and virtuous. In your dream we notice the first scoop of water is in “polished wood”? This is meant to be for the washing of the church as God’s word is meditated upon and read daily his spirit makes it clean our conscience making us one with him. The wood represents the natural man who, in the church of Christ will go down into the waters of baptism and the natural man will die but ride again in Christ In the baroque style pagan church this is called holy water is Only for show, this is evident as “polished wood” is the description. Yes the church is highly polished to attract followers but the true meaning is lost in the polish. Religion is highly polished. The silver scoops in the bible speak of redemption and purification. The process of heating silver to burn off the dross and other imperfections is a metaphor used throughout Scripture. God’s Word itself is described in value beyond silver: “The promises of the LORD are pure, like silver refined in a furnace and purified seven times” (Ps 12:6). The purification process was sometimes used as a symbol for the way God tests and refines people: “You have tested us, O God. You have refined us in the same way silver is refined” (Ps 66:10; see also Isa 48:10). A silversmith would have to attentively watch the silver, getting it to just the right heat, in order to purify the metal. God also watches us as he put us through fiery trials, never leaving us for an instant and only allowing the situation to progress to the point where it is helpful for our sanctification. In the church of Venus the water and silver scoops are just for show however Venus may expect her followers to perform rituals suitable for her? What’s missing here is the gold of course which represents the golden nature of Jesus. Peter the disciple and apostle makes mention of silver and gold showing the true meaning of being washed in water and refined by fire. [END]"}

Should you ask her this is the question? This is in part why you go digging, looking for an answer and that’s when you saw the ice see comments previous post. You meet 2 women? The man leading the dig is obviously you looking at the well the old relationship. His daughter with the dark hair is your old relationship it’s in the dark now after so long a time so it’s hard to figure it out again. She plays hard to get but eventually decided that she likes you, but is that enough? The second woman is probably yourself with the light hair consciously much more aware and confident of yourself than ever before. It’s interesting that you chose the light haired woman, this is the new woman in your life Eg the gym the new language etc this is the one you chose. You have to hurt, that is emotional pain which causes growth, one of these women because they both love you but one is not good for your new growth and would inadvertently stop you growing Eg new language, gym membership etc these speak of a man who is growing and looking after himself physically and spiritually. The dark haired woman who you had to dig deep into your past would potentially throw you off track if you chose her? But the light haired woman being the new you is the one you chose and the right choice?  [END]"}

I try stuffing myself, slat by slat between the wooden slats under the bed and the mattress, but this actually feels very exposed and like the wood might snap, attracting dinosaur. I wanted to be wrapped up in several several blankets and have boxes and things stacked in front of me in a closet, or hide my face amongst stuffed animals like an E.T., but all this moving is making noise and there isn’t adequate stuff to cover me. I'm making noise and time is running out. For all I know I'm attracting the things which are certainly killing people in this huge boarding house/hotel. I cross the hall and chance finding a hiding spot in another room, when I decide on a real solution and slip outside the window and I'm standing on winging bricks that wrap around the building like in a Hitchcock movie. I remember I've dreamed the same dream before and the raptors can scale and climb all over the outside of the building, too. But I don't see any. Finally I decide, screw this place, and run across the lawn toward traffic. Now my lovely friend is there with me and now a raptor is chasing us both. It seems obvious that the raptor is going to catch us, but she yells out that we've beat it before, like everything will be fine, and indeed we make it into traffic. I'm hoping it will be hit. We make it into a parked food truck, where men are working. The fear of raptor-pursuit is greatly reduced. I tell them to take me anywhere but there. Rebecca, on the other hand, confidently tells them to drop her right back off by the front of the lawn and confidently struts back toward the hotel. This is right after I say the words out loud \"take me anywhere but there\". ;  Background_Info: Years ago I'd dream about dinosaurs and the end of the world a lot. I don't know about raptors. There used to be a lot of holding still In the presence of T-Rex. ;  Wakeup_State: I woke up to a blizzard blowing in through the back door then Los Lobos singing La Bamba started playing on my phone. ###","completion":" The combination of hiding from dinosaurs, specifically raptors, and the E.T. stuffed toy suggests the experience is out of Jurassic Park (both also Steven Spielberg films popular during the 1990's). Maybe you've associated something about the time you watched these films with the desire to go on an adventure that is often terrifying. I know I used to have very intense zombie dreams that felt both exciting and terrifying. I watched the zombie films and tv shows when I had a chronic sleep disorder and was unemployed and they were the one real adventure i felt I had in my life. I get the sense my own zombie dreams/ nightmares were a sign I wasn't living the adventure my life was supposed to be, and so enacted it in my dreams instead. [END]"}

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was attacked by this older man who chased me except I didn't experience it in the dream, I just knew he had caught me after running away and watched him leave my apartment (this is now the 7th night in a row I've been chased by him but not caught until now. It's worth mentioning that I always know I'm dreaming and try to \"wake up\" so that I can make him stop chasing me but I'm always unable and he gets too close for comfort so I run away). Anyways, when he leaves, I escape out my apartment balcony by jumping and land safely, feeling guilty for leaving my dog behind. I sprint to catch the bus and when I board it, I begin to question if I am dreaming. I can't think around the fact that the dream took place in my apartment for a moment, but I work around that by considering that the apartment I just saw was unpainted and I recently painted mine, and that I escaped bgy jumping which would be impossible. I suddenly wake up and can't tell if I'm dreaming or really on the bus so I ask the woman in front of me, \"excuse me Bonnie, where is this bus going?\" Because I knew if she answered then I was obviously dreaming since I could call her anything and have her answer. She said something like, \"Oh well, things are going all over the place these days and I can't hardly ever keep track. I just go for the ride.\" I woke up and told the bus to stop, which it did and all the passengers froze. Next, I pointed to the ground and wanted for my dog to be there and he appeared and listened when I told the dream that he needed to be a good boy (he lay down and smiled). Next, I closed my eyes, told the bus to go to a lavender field on a beach instead, and when I opened my eyes the bus pulled up near a beautiful beach where I stepped off, smelt the sea air and lay in the field to relax. I haven't had the horrible dream of being sexually chased since. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" My take on it is the older man represents wisdom I think, and the forced sexual acts and running from it is something along the lines of the refusal to accept some horrible truth , something you are not comfortable with which would be why the unwanted sexual act is used as a symbol. I think this is then symbolized as a cyclic thing that you keep being forced toward something repeatedly over and over but refuse to confront, preferring to intellectually close the door on it. But it doesn't go away, it just comes back again and again. I'm not sure what that would be, but I would think it relates to the donkey/ mule/ ass being led by the soulless zombie chick all dressed up in a very feminine pink dress... Interesting because it shifts from the old masculine man to this image... I'm trying to wrap my head around that...Then steam punk guy, might be around future stuff somehow, tries to make you confront this but you can't bring yourself to do it. You go back to the old cycle rather than learn what you don't want to. The game sequence is an inner conflict you are fighting between the masculine side and feminine side. I'm thinking this could be the thinking vs feeling aspects. Maybe that is why earlier it is running from the male and the female - running from the conflict of the two. Perhaps that is the significance of this fight? You don't want to confront it because of the nerves (ripping out the nervous system)? It also could be implied in the chicks being zombies; ie not thinking pending weight to the feminine feeling aspect in polar opposition to the thinking side? Are you conflicted on what you think vs feel over something? Daniels link to Bluebeard as a mythical symbol could imply that it relates to the engagement, though I am not getting anything else in the dream that would imply that, unless he is a bit of an ass that you have to lead around everywhere hence pink zombie chick; as a part of you that you aren't facing up to...?

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: After walking up a long set of stairs, I reached a road and a bird came down and attacked a small snake hiding in some short grass. At first it looked like the bird had the snake, but the snake twisted out and got free. The bird attacked again, and this time the snake bit the bird as they were struggling. The bird dropped the snake, and the snake bit me, before the bird grabbed it again. I was initially worried, as I've encountered snakes a lot in my last job, but then realised it was probably too small to hurt me. I didn't recognise the species of bird or snake, but the snake wasnt big (30-40cm). ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" The stairs allow you to move from one level to another level, in this case it might mean ascending to a spiritual level since you arrive at the road on top of the stairs. The road takes you on a pathway to a new place however it’s the journey that is highlighted here. Your dream and your comments reveal 2 figures who have some understanding about snakes. You have said that “I’ve encountered snakes in my last job”. As well the bird in her job also encounters snakes in her job. The bird knows her job with snakes well. She doesn’t muck around she attacks the seemingly small snake 3 times. Let’s look. Firstly she reveals the snake “hiding in the grass” the bird takes no chances she will either eat the snake or act protectively since she knows the snake is a threat to her family. You on the other hand look at the snake and because of its small size deem it harmless. Note the difference between you and the bird. The next thing we notice is what happens in the pursuing 3 attacks. On the first attack the birds keen eye for danger reveals the hiding place of the snake “the short grass” which is beside the road you use to take this new journey. The short grass suggests it’s drought resistant quality however not quite enough coverage to escape the keen eyesight of the bird who is always on guard. The bird is teaching you what to look for and how to behave on your journey since the small size does not cause her to see the snake as harmless. The bird attacks the first time but the snake by changing its shape manages to find a way out of the birds beak. The snakes is adaptable firstly hiding in short grass then when cornered simply twisting itself or changes its shape to release itself. The second attack is different, the bird and the snake struggle but the “harmless snake” actually bites the bird causing the bird to drop the snake in front of you. Now the snake is fully exposed right in front of your eyes and what does it do, it now bites you because as as the bird is a threat so too are you a potential threat but unlike the bird you still see the snake as harmless until you also get bitten. So I said the bird is teaching you not to see the small snake as entirely harmless. The bird attacks the snake for the third time after having bitten both of you and still the struggle goes on. In your last job, before you climbed the stairs you worked with snakes enough to know that small snakes don’t pose a real threat however after you climb to the staircase you still apply the same logic in the same old way but the behaviour of the bird now teaches you something new, that is in your new life journey you might consider that even small snakes can hide in short grass and still have the capacity to bite especially once they are exposed.

Sandwich =  close together, perhaps this is a nourishing closeness or perhaps this is a hasty and pressed together feeling closeness. The thought that the dream is about considering someone moving in might suggest that the pressing together of different people into relationship, or overlap of different areas of life, might feel overwhelming.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I found myself in a hospital room. I don't know how I got there or why I was there, the room was pleasantly sunny. I wasn't scared but rather calm and fully okay with the situation, almost contempt. I was visited by a man my age whom I don't know in real life, he seemed to be sort of a partner to be. When he left I was visited by yet another man, my ex partner. I don't recall if there was any conversation but the spirits were high and there was also no sense of distress to the situation, it was like meeting an old friend that you still hold a lot of affection for because you simply like the person. Then he also left. Now off to the part I'm most intrigued about. When I was left alone the feeling of a quiet contentment persisted. I found myself holding up a small mirror and looked into it. To my absolute surprise, my face above the eye line was split open. The opening starting from around the space between my eyebrows. I recall the skin hanging to the right side (in the mirror). I was surprised but nowhere near in a state in which I would be if this happened to me in real life. Trust me, I like my face the way it is. In the dream the feeling was that of curiosity. I looked inside my head and there to the right I found two pieces of some type of long, beige, spongy material. I was under the impression that I had undergone a brain surgery and the pieces were there to hold the hemisphere in place. What's worth noticing is that I felt the operation happened years earlier and wasn't the reason I was now in the hospital room. Another thing I very strongly recall is that my left (in the mirror) side of the brain was hurting me, it was inflamed. I had to wake up at that point as I don't recall anything past that. ;  Background_Info: Now, it would be worth adding that some time ago I had a very powerful experience that shifted my perception in such a drastic way I was able to immediately stop drinking alcohol after a decade of killing myself with it.

I had a dream once where I was all but dead and buried underground in a maze of warrens etc. Then an ambulance turns up with 3 hospital attendants, 2 bearing a stretcher and one leading the way. They sort of made their way to where I was buried in the Warren, rescued me, carried me out on the stretcher , placed me in the ambulance and took me to hospital. For me the hospital staff were angels of god who came to rescue me from my life situation. For me the hospital I was taken too was church where I was well cared for and recovered. Sometimes we don’t understand what happens , how we are cared for but it happens. In your dream you also find yourself in hospital, a place to be cared for a place to recover. We notice your situation is “pleasant” you are at ease and relaxed, also “sunny” suggesting your outlook on life is good and the atmosphere of the sun is healing. You are not scared, “calm and fully ok with the situation and almost content” so in fact your hospital whatever it represents to you is a great place for you in your life right now.\r\nWhile in the hospital you have 2 visitors, a partner from the present and a partner from your past. These 2 partners are a part of you. It looks as if some kind of reconciliation is going on between your past life and present life represented by the 2 loving and caring partners. The 2 partners are not causing distress but rather “affection” These 2 visits may represent a reconciliation between past and present bringing together the healing you require Also you speak of the left and right hemisphere in your brain again we see this balancing going on for you between left and right past and present.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: The sense of place has a strange feel to it despite the mundane descriptions. I'm in a city, I experience being aboard something like a stationary train or tram, I'm lacking a requirement to travel back on the train, I think I wish to buy a piece of cake before my return journey for some reason, but I'm trying to fish out my payment card and ID card and making other passengers wait, I see my bags on the floor unzipped, my belongings bulging out of them in an unorganized fashion as I fish around on my person for my cards, I feel the passengers impatience with me. Then I'm standing in something approximating a shopping mall, apparently attempting a different route of travel, standing in front of a phone with old fashioned handset in my hand like those of old phone boxes. I lift up the handset a couple of times, the unusual looking digital screen flickers slightly but fails to spring to life, I lift it a third time and the phone and display then connects successfully. I speak in a slightly shakey voice, stating that I wish to attain something, perhaps this cake I'm after by relaying my card details, to then travel back by alternative means, perhaps by car, and the natural sounding voice I recognize as artificial intelligence identifies by the sound of my voice that I am somehow unfit, as though drunk and intending to drive, only not that, and manages to deduce I'm breaching some rule in what I am asking, recognizing I must be traveling back by a method I'm unfit to do in this circumstance, based upon my request. I'm then elsewhere walking on some dim grey street, having traveled another different route, I see a person walking in front of me, I recognize them as a second instance of an identical person I've just seen at the opposite end of the road I'm walking down, beyond them I see an oddly distinct looking vehicle drive around the corner of a road, at that moment another identical vehicle drives around the same corner in the opposite direction. Then I find myself at a different scene, looking at a damaged, blackened decrepit shell of a helicopter leaning towards the edge of a small muddy pit of water beside it. I pan my head right and there is a small glass cubicle, like the glass cockpit of a crane or digger, with a man sat inside it. Beside him is a cake, he asks me what size slice I'd like, I gesture with my finger and thumb the thickness, but my hand is shakey, I worry this looks suspect somehow, I hold my hand with my other hand to steady it, struggling to indicate a sufficient thickness of slice. He serves me a slice of cake within two slices of bread, like a sandwich with some salad in it also. A bit odd, I thought. I took a bite, I sense the cool temperature of the salad. I ask the person that served me the cake 'what month were you born in?' as if to inquire his relatedness to me, as one might enquire to infer anothers zodiac sign. He says 'I was born in such-and-such a year', (I forget the actual year) clearly failing to understand the concept of a month, answering like a somewhat poorly programmed artificial intelligence humanoid. Then I'm in a car with this person and also my dad, setting off somewhere.

You do have a destination but it’s on an unseen shore, somewhere. It’s not that you don’t know where you’re going because you do, it’s just at the moment unseen, and it’s not like it’s nowhere in fact it is somewhere, it is a real place you have set off towards. It’s the way you are getting there that is the question not how because we know how, it’s on the big ship, organization? You are sitting on top of the load because you are responsible to make sure this load of hay reaches its destination. The how you reach and arrive suggests it will be by faith. The supplies and transport you are already a part of but the journey into the destination is unseen suggesting it is a journey by faith. Notice the “voice” that you “sense” of someone not seen in the dream as compared to the “words” of your own dismissing this “suggestion”. Notice the battle going on in your mind? You have set out on a journey with a load of supplies/hay and you are responsible to see that it arrives safely at this unseen destination.

This creates doubt and the thoughts are activated by fear. Let’s look at how you turn the battle, after you “sense” the “voice” you now “hear” “words” This is very different because your words are containers also and they contain faith and with this faith you dismiss the “incorrect notion” that “someone else had made” This is a battle going on in your mind you set out with confidence you set out with supplies for sheep and cattle because they are the ones who more likely feed on hay although goats eat hay they mainly forage not graze. So the doubt that someone is trying to place inside your head is that the group you are sending supplies to are not even worthy of the supplies/vast amount of nutritious food. You correct this foolish notion with words not senseless notions. You overcome your struggle to reach your destination where in fact where there are no goats.

It’s not the only bedroom I had in childhood, but it is the one in the home we shared with him, and the room I had through my most formative years. The room is barren, but I’m painting it a baby blue color. Suddenly I notice he’s in the room with me; I’m not sure when he came in, but when I turn around he’s painting over my blue with a dark red. I start screaming “Stop! Can’t you see I’m trying to paint it blue? Why can’t you see that? Stop!” He ignores me, and suddenly the bat I used to play softball with in the time I lived there is in my hands.

Being in the room you shared tells me that the dream is about the mindset you occupy around this issue. There are always many threads to the symbols and lots of different ways to approach them. My interpretation is just one suggestion. It seems the room has been cleared in preparation of remodelling and renovation. Your psyche needs an update in some way. Yet you used the word \"barren\" so it may also be that this space internally has become a barren and empty place for you. I wonder if you have tried to clear away the issue in some way, or you just want to paint it over and cover up what happened. Maybe that's something you tried to do when you were young. Baby blue suggests an innocence. A color we might paint for a new baby's room. Blue is the color of the throat chakra, the center of our communication, it invites us to talk and express ourselves, especially verbally. It's also a color of peace and tranquility. I feel that the painting is a way of saying i want to start again. I want to prepare for a new beginning, to clear away the old and welcome in the new. The color is \"light\" and insights those themes too. But the man seems to have too much power because he is always able to undo your efforts. Red is a very emotive color bringing them of lust, passion, danger and anger. I feel the scene is describing what occupies your mental space over the issue. It seems he is still able to take over and \"color”\" things. I’m sure this experience in many ways has \"colored\" or informed the rest of your life, perhaps with a darkness. Your asking him to stop is very positive because you recognize the unwanted and ongoing influence in your life. But your pleas and physical attempts to make it stop are not working. And I feel this probably the crux of it. It's very very sad and unfair, this man violated you when you were a powerless. He broke the law, the trust of your family and broke every sacred boundary that is held by good decent loving people. The softball racket I feel represents your efforts as a child who nearly did not have the power to make it stop by her own efforts. That was not your fault and I feel the dream is repeating because it wants to call you forward as the adult you now are. It's replaying this internal video because its still playing out in various ways within you. You need to address the issue to get the dream to change and hopefully stop. The painting shows that you want to start over. Painting your own childhood room and the location of your pain, suggests you want to welcome the child who you were. She still lives within you, painting her room in a new and fresh way invites healing and safety and a way to refresh yourself for a new start. [END]"}

In Genesis God walks with Adam in the Garden similar to you and Peterson walking through your city. Both God and Peterson walk with Adam and you through there own respective areas. As God walks with Adam he teaches him to cultivate the garden because God is a Husbandman he teaches him Knowledge (tree of knowledge) and he shows him how to continually regenerate his life (tree of Life) in short God created Adam and Adam enjoyed these walks with God until he sinned. In your case I see Something similar, Peterson has created a following. He walks with you(continually instructs those he created) but here is where it’s different instead of knowledge and imparting of spiritual life suggesting honor and integrity. Instead we see tricks and lies? In the dream we see that Peterson is your “close friend” I wonder if you have created “a Peterson” that will teach you what you want to hear? This idea is not too far fetched since that’s exactly what man has done, they forgot the true God and created their own god and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles. So I see the exchange taking place here,as you walk with this “close friend” in your city/ garden. What is noticeable is that “psyche tricks (mind games) and “how to spot liars” a small round or roundish mark, differing in color or texture from the surface around it. See, notice, or recognize (someone or something) that is difficult to detect or that one is searching for. To spot something is basically to detect it then mark it/ spot it. Again this is exactly what God did with Cain after the murder of Able, he spotted him that is he placed a mark upon him so that others seeing Cain would not harm him for what he did to His brother. The mark of Cain is God's promise to offer Cain divine protection from premature death with the stated purpose of preventing anyone from killing him. It is not known what the mark was, but it is assumed that the mark was visible. So we see that when God spotted the liar he then marked him out for DIVINE PROTECTION until he could devise a way to brim him back to integrity or REDEEM him since he was unable to redeem himself.

Jung would say the turtle is a common symbol of the Self, a turtle on it's back or about to fall might represent a less than ideal state of the Self, one in need of/lacking help. He has also described the turtle as representing the transcendent function, that which unites the opposites. Jung has also said reptile-like scales - and the dragon - are associated with the sympathetic nervous system. Incidentally, the sympathetic nervous system is what constricts blood vessels, allowing them to move through smaller spaces under pressure, as you were in this dream. I wonder whether your blood taking on a watery quality is somehow also related. You said you woke up cold. vasoconstriction of the blood vessels is what keeps you warm when cold. Ordinarily, blood is associated with emotion, in Jungian interpretations. To me, this dream seems like it might be about integration of the personal Shadow, in order to aid the development of the Self, but given your point about watery blood, crawling along constricted routes, and waking up cold, I wonder whether this dream is simply a response to your physical state at the time of the dream.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: My sister got surgery to turn her tongue into a penis. We were sitting in the car me and her in the backseat while my husband was driving. I kept wondering if she can taste anything now since she doesn't have any taste buds. And also if she regrets it. because it's a life long alteration to her body. I for some reason said to her. I guess your transgender? And she said no she's still a girl. And then I agreed since I guess it's only her tongue. And for some reason she ended up jerking off her tongue in the backseat of the car while I was there and hubby driving. But it was a literal explosion of cum after. I was so grossed out. Cause she had came all over me and some got in my mouth. And I got mad and said. That it was unconscentual sperm or something.and then got napkins to clean up. Then we went to this place and my sister came with us. But she kept poking Out her dick tongue and I kept telling her to put it away, there could be children. Then she kinda disappeared. Me and my husband were having alot of fun and I was telling him we should come here more often. Things we're closing up and so we were getting ready to go, I went over to the trash to take gum out of my mouth, but for some reason no matter how much gum I took out of my mouth there was always gum in my mouth. Until there was a huge pile. And even then I still had gum so gave up. Which sucked cause the gum didn't even have flavor anymore and was gross. I went to look for my sister and in one area there was a bunch of different displays, like museum artifacts. And I kept spinning this movable display and then all of a sudden I seen my sister dead in the case. It was more a flash of her head, and then this weird objects that symbolized her.

You feel this intimately (sexually) as if her problems are being cum-ed onto you. But you also care about her, because she is your sister. It's because you care so much about her that you feel her issues so intimately. Due to her inappropriate behaviors, you think she will end up \"dead\" somehow and pay for her obscenities by being on display. And of course you feel sad, because you love your sister. I think the gum represents crap that you can't seem to get out of your mouth (or life). Much like the cum that your sister jerked out. It's sticky and it doesn't taste good. [END]"}

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I visit the town and I walk along the street with someone Idk (but do in this dream). I realise something is wrong and that all of the shops now have weird names. Still their names but either with a night/dream pun or some night/dream logo. The person idk (Let’s call him P, I guess) sat on a bench and I ask them wth is going on, they confirm it was my town but that it’s called Whoville now. Very confused, we walk into this shop. The manager is walking around shouting ‘Make sure […] don’t fall asleep in my shop!’. Some guy looks drunk and as if he’s going to fall asleep. P helps him out of the shop and he’s grateful. Soon after, the shops begin to close and the place looks dark and gloomy. All the shops looked as if they were abandoned. Broken windows, lights, and cafés had food laying around. People walking around went into different shops. A group of women were in this café next to me and began eating. Quickly, they all collapsed. P complains that this is just like ‘so and so shop’ and that people just shouldn’t take the risk anymore! I quickly realised that they were all dead. (For some reason) I and P break the windows of a real estate shop and see this very old, short man with black hair and small glasses. He wore old fashioned but fancy clothes. We talk to him for a bit, ask him questions etc. Turns out that you can either leave your shop in view or hide it. If you leave it in view you can leave a light on to let people know […]. He said that it was stupid and he would never do that. He continues to talk and I look over to see candles lit at a window. I quickly blew them out so that he wouldn’t notice. They came back. I repeated this until I ran to a lever that hid the shop. All of the windows were now gone, replaced by wood. The man ran out back and we followed. (Idk what happened next) ((THIS IS THE PART I REMEMBER DREAMING ABOUT BEFORE)) He gives in and starts talking about the town and his childhood. Under this shop, there was a huge cavern. As a kid, he and some townsfolk went down there (for some reason). All of a sudden, he found this girl around his age. She wore a gorgeous blue dress and bonnet with white trim. They talked and talked and they had a great time. The town and he all had to escape the cavern and he begged the girl to come. He dragged her up all the scaffolding with the town. Just as they reached the door back into the shop, part of the scaffolding was gone. The town (already on the other side) tried to help but there wasn’t much they could do. He held onto her and she begged him to leave her here and he jumped successfully to the door. He said ‘We made it!’. But then the girl, still in his arms, said that she wasn’t finished here yet and like a snake slithered out of his arms and fell back into the cavern. The man said that he had stayed there for years hoping to finally be able to save that girl. I and P both nodded toward each other and we went out the back door and began our climb down into the cavern, the man not far behind us. With our flashlights, we looked around for ages. Eventually, we found the girl who wore the same blue dress. The man was ecstatic and began to talk to her. All was well until all of a sudden she began to transform into this huge snake-like creature (with small legs and she was still wearing the dress). (I don’t remember why but) She began to attack us. Quickly, we ran back up the scaffolding and into the shop. She slithered her way up and partially through the door. ;  Background_Info: I’ve had this dream before. It probably isn’t exactly the same but it’s still the same dream. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" I looked at the first part of your dream and here is what I see: Shops are essentially symbols for people. When we come to earth we do so to pursue our purpose, develop and embody our gifts which we offer to each other hence the shop reference. The manager usually refers to brain, so the brain is preoccupied with keeping the body alive (ie not falling asleep which effectively means to die in dream language) P (this is probably your teaching guide) in the dream helps someone out of the shop - meaning helping someone cross over back to the spirit world. This is very important spiritual assistance and I believe the dream is telling you you can do this also. People (souls) then go to another shop, meaning another incarnation. When the shop closes (meaning the consciousness leaves the body), place looks dark and gloomy. Reference to food/death (reminded me of artist Lyubov Panchenko death in Ukraine). The second part whereby you have a choice to leave your shop in view or hide it, looks like a choice to offer your consciousness, light to others as a support when crossing over - like a 'ferry men'. You can do that during nightime sleep (with conscious commitment before going to bed). But it seem there is warning that this entails travelling to places where death is present (war zones, nursing homes, hospice etc) which could have certain impact on a being. Hiding the shop, replacing the windows with wood would be shielding away from this (protection boundaries). Window usually refers to clairvoyance /third eye, so that would be shut. It s a deep dream and I suggest you ponder on the messages it s giving you especially since you had a similar dream before. [END]"}

When we are passive people and we try to be assertive, we feel like we are being aggressive. You can still be respectful of others and speak your truth.

I couldn't get the television off, the remote wasn't working. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: I woke up shaking with my heart hammering. It disturbed me. ###","completion":" 2 scenes relating to tv and cinema, public viewing and private viewing. Large lifelike screen compare small Home Screen Possible adult viewing compare toy teddy bear. While I don’t understand all of this some things stand out? For me the cinema is a large screen that has the power to bring its movies/ entertainment to life for the viewer. You seem to understand this concept of the cinema as a mechanism that has the power to breathe life into what ever is fed into the projectors. To me the fact that you have stayed behind is to make use of this mechanism by turning it on yourself. You go there to see for yourself the larger than life screen, it’s intention is for informing and to entertain but somewhere along the line you have realized that by looking into something you can bring it to life just like the toy teddy bear at home on your tv. The toy teddy bear is a comfort to you it’s strength it’s warm fur can be your friend and companion as a toy is your friend howbeit lifeless. Bears are not mean or malicious; they are very gentle and tolerant animals. Mother bears are affectionate, protective, devoted, strict, sensitive and attentive with their young. Not unlike people, bears can be empathetic, fearful, joyful, playful, social and even altruistic. Her is what you see in the toy teddy bear perhaps but as you look at it begins to undergo a change something is happening that s bring it to life just from watching it on the tv? Your toy teddy bear is undergoing a change the monster within his breaking through this once lovable toy. The tv scene has taught you somehow there is a way to bring things to life except instead of bringing the best out of the lifeless toy the transformation of the toy teddy somehow brings out the monster ? Perhaps this intrigued you this transformation of the toy teddy it’s your teddy you should be able to control it right? Looking back at the cinema you understand the same idea that if the tv at home has the power to bring toys to life then how much more power does a larger than life cinema screen have to bring you to life to transform you into much more that you are? You go to the cinema with the idea of using its mechanism that is its projector and film tapes to film yourself and then project yourself onto the big screen. By filming yourself and projecting yourself onto the cinema screen you attempt to bring out the inner you to bring you to life that is what the cinema screen is designed to do. However just like the toy bear that is harmless and comforting a monstrous change takes place you find that you are now being chased around this cinema you know you shouldn’t be doing this transformation stuff but you can’t resist. Now that you have released your inner self and bought it to life via the mechanism of the cinema you find that it has released a monster just like the toy bear? It chased you why? Because you have miscalculated that you think you are in control but by circumventing natural methods of growth and try to release the inner and more powerful you like the bear seem to turn on yourself and it is no longer your friend no longer a comfort but in breathing life into something that’s not ready it turns on you. In summary it seems like you are dabbling with the inner self in ways that are not healthy for you, yes you discovered how to bring things to life but even doctor Frankenstein could do that. The way you go about indulging these transformations are merely mechanical there is no time for healthy integration no time to slowly grow into maturity just a quick fix and a flirt with nature that turns against you.

There are lots of people walking around trying to find the way out, but getting nowhere. One of them is an old dancing partner when I was taking ballroom dancing lessons. I get the impression of a long time searching for the proper path. The focus of the dream is when I come to an old temple, Ancient Greek-ish with a large granite statue, specifically granite with a rustic pinkish hue. Looking up into the temple roof I realise no one is up there and it dawns on me that the path is likely up there as no one down here has found the way, so I head up there. The dream then goes to an out of body view of the path. There is an above ground bridge like structure, and the way corkscrews as a tunnel around it.

And how you are there with many other people trapped in this underground, and one is former dance partner. Dance here can also be synonymous with that \"trance\" metaphor. Here, the struggle to find meaning of the unconscious while staying submerged in the unconscious. \"I was never good at that dance anyway, I gave it up when I had a family\". The defensive survivalist mode was never appealing for you to be stuck in, and having a family moved you further out of that. Which makes sense to me. To consciously choose to have a family, it requires a huge amount of hope and faith and optimism. And a longer view. And a broader understanding of the self, knowing that the lower self for example immediate needs is not the whole self, which allows one to have more patience and delayed gratification, more giving. Because you can think of not just the immediate self, but also the past and future selves, a very expansive view of self that takes us out of immediate reactivity and makes us look at a wider overview. Also though, the larger view of self and how that links with starting a family is the selfless love of having a family. That our well-being is now so palpably connected to ensuring the well-being of our family. It is a reminder we are not just alone, selfishness is very very narrow of a view. People are quite interconnected, whether we can see that overview or not. [END]"}

I’ve been on a road of healing ever since and since I firmly believe (with some psychology background under my belt now and knowing what I know about him) that my ex is a narcissist, ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" I think, for what it's worth, that if you consciously understand that she is both guilty and a victim of your husband at the same time, perhaps in the subconscious you are both legitimately angry at her and a little angry at yourself, both for being a victim of a narcissist and in a sense for not forgiving her. Just to clarify, I don't mean you should forgive her or think you really did forgive someone else for the same thing. I'm just taking a punt at what YOU might feel underneath, and if it's off base, no worries, I'm just wrong. I suspect that because it's a complicated issue, because there's a conflict between her guilt and victimhood, it's just difficult to know whether you should a. be angry with her for her guilt or b. forgive her because she's also another of your ex-husband's victims. I don't know either, but just to reassure you, those conflicting emotions are all normal and valid. IF you have any anger towards yourself, whether for being his victim, for not doing enough to keep the family together (that's a bullshit lie if you ever feel that), for not forgiving her (yet or IF you ever decide to), that anger is also valid in context of how difficult the situation is but also misplaced. Because you have been mistreated, partly by her, it makes perfect sense that you can't just forgive her casually, just because she's also a victim. It makes sense that you might feel like she's following you and blaming you or acting entitled to forgiveness automatically, because the confusion and hurt follow you. I would also suggest that you are a forgiving person, if you have a subconscious awareness of forgiving people for certain things, but it isn't as simple as that when you're the victim, particularly of betrayal *(the worst of all sins, if you will). You couldn't help and don't bare any responsibility for the fact that he was a dishonest, selfish bastard who couldn't keep his pants on or that she fell for things and didn't reject a married man. You weren't not enough. He wasn't enough to meet you where you were and prioritise family, love, and personal sacrifice for long-term gain. [END]"}

The boa is not a threat to humans in fact the boa is sometimes used in harmony with villages and communities etc to help rid them of too many rats and mice etc. The boa in your dream is said to have killed the villagers more than likely this boa is an introduced species, a hybrid when introduced to an area can be too much competition to the local species by taking all their food and ruining the local habitat similar to feral cats in Australia which wipe out all the local wildlife in this case it’s also disrupting the villagers as well because the economic balance upon the land and wildlife is disrupted by the introduced boa who out competes the wildlife which in turn has drastic effects upon the villagers.\r\nThe guide: A good guide would likely be a local,someone familiar with the villagers and the surrounding land. he would act on behalf of the villagers and the local wildlife by educating people like Richard Attenborough does. This guide is a snake that is disguised as a boa, notice of the orbs he calls them the boa but he changes his shape into a snake? They are both very different in their nature but up until now he has fooled the community into thinking it is the boa doing all the damage. This guide is not a native boa who represent no threat to the villagers he is the cause of them loosing their livelihoods. Being the guide he is supposed to understand the fine balance and harmony of nature with the villagers as they cohabit together. This boa behaves at odds to the native boa who keep the land clean of too many rats and mice without damaging the Environment which is good for the villagers. This introduced hybrid boa is the opposite in his behavior, looks like a boa but is a rogue snake. He takes advantage of this simple harmony that exists between the balanced community and the land and its inhabitants? he is selling them short. He acts like a guide but inside he is a snake, a hybrid snake, a feral snake, a wild snake without proper thought to the economic balance of nature. he has no qualms about selling his people out and when confronted, quickly changes shape to his true identity which of course is a feral snake,not a boa! I say feral because the boa does not represent a threat to man it is the other way around it is men who use their boa skin for bags etc. this snake is a feral snake who has ruined the habitat and the lively hood of the villagers. The orbs have not threatened the woman they have revealed themselves as the true guides of the land? When confronted with this revelation the false guide changes from a guide to a feral snake wanting to also kill the team because they have exposed him? At first he says they are the boa and then he turns into a snake. The orbs possibly the villagers and the boa are the true guides of the land who have looked after the land by their balanced lifestyle but now that balance is being ruined by the feral snake. The real boa rid the land of too many and unwanted rats and mice now take it upon themselves to expose the false guide allowing themselves to be filmed by the camera which provides proof of how they live, proof that they have not damaged the land neither each other! the villagers loose their livelihoods because of bad land practise The feral snake was easily able to disguise himself as a local boa supposedly harmless but beneficial. The local and native boa only live harmoniously and contributes to the well being of all they are true keepers of the Enviroment. They were also able to expose the fake boa as a snake! The nature of the feral snake is to kill by the damage he causes to the Enviroment. However the nature of the hunter within the team is also to kill but not as a feral but in a controlled atmosphere, that is when he finds the feral snake he will certainly kill it!\r\nLooking at the Team again: Whoever choose the team was very clever. The snake disguised as the boa was initially chosen as part of the team possibly so that it could be exposed. the identity of the snake is suspected from the start but proof is required! The woman member of the team provides this proof by use of her wildlife camera attached to her vehicle. She finds the orbs who are the true boa as the snake guide himself loudly exclaims.. “ they are the boa”She has the evidence and also tricked the snake into a confession. Once the proof is exhibited the guide can no longer masquerade as a harmless boa therefore his only option is to shift back to his true self which is the snake. As the snake changes back to its true intentions he wants to kill them however the Hunter who up until now has not been able to do his job properly because he was looking for boa not a feral snake. He could not find the boa because they had retreated into the jungle but now he sees them in the camera and realizes the boa are not at fault but the snake is the rogue guide. Now that the hunter has been provided the correct information he can now hunt accordingly to set a trap for the snake which is different from the boa.\r\nComparing the snake serpent biblically: The snake in the bible is similar to the snake in your dream. The biblical serpent dress’s itself up as a Christian nice long robes declaring itself as a guide to humanity all the while ruining the balance and relationship with man and God. In your dream the snake and the boa are of the same species but are totally different. The boa cares for the land and its inhabitants just like the Christian does but the Christian is often like the boa in your dream blamed for the damage the snake has caused. The snake in the bible will be exposed as a snake a deceiver and a liar even though it it dressed in beautiful robes it will be cast down. The color of the Christian is white not purple which tends to dazzle and seduce its prey a said higher enlightenment. The Christian like the villagers in your dream live a simple existence with the owner of the land and the wildlife around it. The snake on the other hand damages that very existence by treachery using trickery to entice its prey to fall from harmony with the creator. The biblical snake is a feral Christian and will loose its place as it is also exposed as its deeds are bought to light by the woman’s / church’s proof which she will bring to the others/ the world. Then the world will see that this snake guide is not a god but only a man, a treacherous man that has caused a lot of damage. [END]"}

It would be fitting that the ‘Self’ (Peterson) would be instructing you in ‘tricks’ of the psyche since it is the cumulative knowledge of the whole psyche. Interesting about spotting liars. Many people suspect people of lying sometimes but then go against their instincts and trust the person only to be betrayed.

But outside people were fighting I was trying to get away as I felt it was getting worse my my husband was In the middle like in the middle of the fight. The next thing we were In our car were my daughter was asleep. My second dream was I was at my mums flat when I noticed a hospital letter for my husband which said he had sad news to tell him. I think they gave him so much time to live. I was really worried about this dream as he is waiting for tests in reality. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: I was worried about the second dream as it was about bad news. ###","completion":" It’s possible that your husband and daughter are representing aspects of you. So you feel like you’re in the middle of some fight that’s going on and you just want to get away. Being asleep can represent being unaware of something, maybe how to move forward since it’s in the car. Your masculine side is in bad shape and needs help; that is, you need to feel more in charge.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I am walking around a dilapidated city. It is an urban area. There are bridges here and there, I walk around - supposedly using a map. Not too sure. I end up having navigated myself at a store which contains carpets and other antique looking things. It seems to be an Indian store that sells carpets and furnishings. I go to the end of the store, where the receptionist walks me through, she presents with her hands from the back of the store the view of the whole store into the front. Above me there is a broken escalator which captures my attention, I then look up and notice to my surprise that there are people up there but there is no way to enter the second level of this furnishing store. I then leave the store and walk into a shop that is selling religious photos of Krishna and Radha used for decorating altars. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" There's a lot of layers in this dream. I'll just tell you what I think the symbols reference. Dilapidated: not taken care of, unhealthy, worn out. (Buildings typically reference the self). Carpeting: something that covers something, like possibly feelings, emotions. Antiques: something from the past. Broken escalator going up: a means to get to a 'higher' level isn't working. The other people on the higher floor represent different aspects of your personality, character. In other words, something is holding you back, and likely something from the past. [END]"}
{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was at some kind of archeological dig. The man leading the dig had a daughter, a beautiful woman about my age, and after playing hard to get, she decided she really liked me. Later in the dream, I met another beautiful woman, also my age, who also really liked me. This made the situation difficult, since I had to decide which one to hurt. It wasn't a pleasant choice. In the end, I chose the second woman.  Now, I associate these women with my anima. What does anyone here think about this? Does this indicate some kind of \"split?\" Another detail is that the first woman had dark hair, and the second woman had light hair. Normally, I find dark-haired women more attractive, yet I chose the light-haired one. What do you all think? Why would I have to choose to hurt one? Is this related to my recent re-connection?  Later in the dream, I found myself next to a well. A man standing there said that it was pretty cold. Even though it was cold in my room as I was sleeping, in the dream, I suddenly felt hot. I looked down into the well, and saw ice floating in the water there. I drew up the bucket, and doused myself with it, which was very refreshing. ;  Background_Info: I've recently been in contact with an ex-girlfriend from more than twenty years ago. We had a bad ending to our relationship (my fault), but she's forgiven me, and we're friends now. We've been in contact quite frequently. I'm learning another language, signed up for a gym; things are improving. I am fairly certain that if I asked her to, she would move here for me. I'm not sure if that's what I want, or if it's wise, but that's my perception of the situation. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" I guess you don't make the decision because you're afraid to lose opportunities with other women (perhaps better to the one you have).I personally think it's a mind trick...

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: Part one: I enter a large stone building that is shaped sort of like an igloo. The building is completely empty but inside looks like it used to be a place of worship or church. At the back there’s a stairway leading up to what seemed to be a large wood stove or oven, that hasn’t been used in a while. I walked up the stairs to the stove to find that it had been converted to a shower and immediately felt that I needed to wash myself. I begin to take my clothes off and noticed that clothes from other people had been left behind. I also noticed that the showerhead had started to run and everyone else’s clothes were getting wet. I had no place to put my clothes down because there was water everywhere. In the dream I never did end up showering because the dream shifted to what seemed like a second part...Part two: Standing there with the water still running, I looked over and saw a television with a show playing. In the show there was a father, a mother, and a young adult son who lived out in the wilderness alone, possibly in some sort of post-apocalyptic situation.￼ The son had down syndrome. He had sunglasses that were broken, but his father was able to fix them for him and he was very appreciative to have his sunglasses back. The family was happy that the father was handy enough to fix the things that were broken in the family. But then the dream shifted to the mother. The family found out that she had a life-threatening condition of some kind, something to do with her brain. Possibly a brain injury of some kind. The father was working on a way to fix her, and his solution involved cutting away her consciousness and transplanting it into himself or some other Avatar so that she could continue living in another being. The son was very concerned about this, but the mother assured him that this was the only way for her to continue existing. The morbid piece was that the father would to have to perform the surgery on her with no sedation due to their circumstances, and the process was going to be torturous and agonizing for her. But she insisted they moved forward anyways. I think she died, but I cannot be sure. The dream ended here. ;  Background_Info: My stresses are through the roof these days. I had a relationship over the weekend at the same time my business closed for COVID. My dreams have been very vivid this week. ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" I think that the first part means that you are revisiting a part of yourself that you may have left behind. Something perhaps spiritual i think that it ties into your stresses because perhaps you've been contemplating your faith in your circumstances. The empty forgotten igloo could be others who have experienced a similar contemplation and the shower is a form of healing Where others have also ventured The tv might represent a family struggle that is parallel to yours In that you see may see yourself reflected in his drastic circumstance.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I was in a hospital. A female colleague of mine from real life was a nurse there. She was treating a patient who was very ill. When she saw me she immediately left him behind and took me down a corridor. I questioned if it was OK to interrupt his treatment. She said he would not be ok if left to his own devices. I told her to go back and save him before speaking to me. I could wait, but she refused. She continued to drag me towards a dark place. I wanted to go back and speak to that patient, and find out why he was left behind like that. My colleague stopped me, visibly worried. She said \"you donr want to find out such things. Better not\". She then proceeded to prepare a syringe, which she stuck in my neck. I panicked. Was she treating me, applying anesthesia or... Killing me? The third scenario was implied. While I was drifting away she said I would have to wait 7 days, afterwards she promises I would get better. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" Well, what does a nurse mean to you?

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: I had a dream that I bought a car from my sister but it wouldn’t crank for some reason as you had to put a band over the gas tank to crank it. I had to put $20 in the tank but the guy who pumped my gas went a little over. I had $50 in my bank account in the dream and the teller said it out loud.

{"prompt":"Dream_Text: It started in the middle for me, I was in my room and a girl i went to school with little sister was there like sitting by a drain and she told me that she kept feeling something touch her through the drain and I look over and she’s not there anymore and I see them trying to grab a stuffed animal that was right beside her thinking it’s me or something and I hit their hand and I screamed, what did you do with, Izzy, but that’s not even her name. I’m freaking out because I’m thinking how much strength did they have to have to pull this little red headed girl through and drain, and how messed up her body was look now! (This whole time I was crying.) So I tell everyone in the house that someone is going through the drains and trying to steal people or anything they can grab. So I get advised by someone to go tell my father which is at my neighbors franks, as I’m telling him what’s happening, the across the street neighbor truck starts going off as if someone’s breaking in. (I want to add some better description of how close we live , imagine a square and it’s three houses but my house has two acres so it would take up the room for the forth house to have our houses right across the street from each other’s) so my dad and frank look at each other and say that’s probably him and after they say that the older guy right across the street with his truck broken into step out his door and screams. “HES HEADED YALLS WAY” so the person who broke in was a mid sized,black male. But I remembered seeing a white hand through the drain. So sense we live so close I tried to run to my house for safety and it was too late, my dad pull out his Glock the guy pulled out his gun and two shots were fired and I just shut my eye and I seen white, and it was like as if I felt the bullets as well but I just kept walking towards my house. I didn’t even look to see who had died I just went back to my room crying to my mom and my boyfriend and as I’m on the floor like hysterically crying I stand up and through the window I see the black male wrapped up (dead) and being put into like a police van. I distinctly remember after I seen his dead body in my head I went “I just seen a dead body”. I went into more of a shock and then more of a hysterical cry, and I remember my mom trying to get my grandma to come out and to calm me down, she gets to my house I head outside, and the last part before I woke I just remember sinking into her arms while falling on the prettiest, greenest grass I’ve ever seen. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __ ###","completion":" This is a pretty complex dream, I’m not sure I have any solid ideas; but it does seem to relate to being influenced by outside forces (those taking people through the drain) and being intruded upon, feeling threatened and conflict. Since it isn’t the black man I think the dream might be hinting the real threat is not the clear seemingly obvious intrusion but rather the seemingly impossible reverse way (through the drain). The grass at the end seems significant, makes me think of lush rich personal growth but through great sorrow and difficulty? [END]"}
