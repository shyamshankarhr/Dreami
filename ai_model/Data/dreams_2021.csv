"In my dream, I was taking a shower in a public shower room that was made of wood. My mother and a religious leader were seated quietly only about two metres away from my spot, and I saw a stranger walking past. I was glancing at each of them as I was enjoying the water, fortunately, they were not looking at my body. I moved my face close to the glass wall to check if it was opaque enough for me not to be seen from the outside, I saw my sister and some strangers walking towards my direction, and I realised I was on the upper floor. The water was strong and clean, and I was enjoying my shower that I don't get any attention though I was naked.",The shower is a cleansing that you are enjoying. You have exposed this issue to those around you. You don't feel self conscious in the dream. This has been a positive experience for you. In this dream you got to be yourself. It's been an enlightening experience for you.
"I had a dream I was in school again and my locker opened up to be this place with a couch and old school computer. I had my tarot cards there and 3 decks had gotten all mixed together and I was trying to straighten them out. I kept finding the wrong cards in different decks. Then I try to log onto the computer and I realized it was my ex roommates ( a person I had a horrible public falling out with, horrible ) girlfriends computer. I then start getting scared the girlfriend is gonna come in, and confused about why her computer is in my locker with my stuff. Then it skips to be talking to this other teacher in a classroom. This teacher ends up being the girlfriends mom and she’s telling me stuff about how their kid can’t have sex , can’t do certain things, and it’s almost like I’m undercover getting this info. I bond with the mom pretty hard. I walk around the school bonding with people almost like I’m undercover.",That this dream is at school is it is about a life lesson. Being there is a locker in the dream symbolizes that you have these issues stored in this locker. You are opening the door and going in. This symbolizes resolving these issues for yourself about this situation. In this dream you are working on this. I see this dream as a start to resolving this for yourself. You have taken a step.
"I have recurring dreams that I’ve lost my purse and I go into a panic frenzy trying to find it. After a long struggle, I end up finding it.",Your purse is your sense of confidence. You store your important things in your purse that you need to function in life. Does your confidence wane? This dream is telling you this. Keeping your confidence up is like keeping your purse. You need to be careful how you handle it. You don't want to lose it.
"I dreamt I got a car because my previous one went wrong. I let a friend (I don't know him in real life but he was a reo3nd in the dream) drive it and he missed a corner and we went off road, sliding through fields til we went into a river. We for our laughing and unhurt and I for another car.That car kept messing about, the boot stated open, or it locked me out etc.",A car is a reflection of yourself in a dream. You changed cars because your old one wasn't working. This is you changing your life because it wasn't working for you. You get another vehicle that seems to be working. You let a dream friend drive. This is actually an aspect of yourself. You are not taking life seriously so the car gets driven of the road and into the river. The river is emotions that you are experiencing. These emotions are getting you off your path. That you get locked out after the crash is saying this change is not a positive move for you.
I dreamt I was crying cause I started arguing with my boyfriend and I felt like I had no where to go because everywhere I live I fight with people. In my dream i told my boyfriend that I had no where to go he said “why would you even think about that”,If you have moved into HIS place rather than moved into a place you share you probably feel like you would have nowhere to go if you argued… I think that’s what your dream is pointing to
"The dream is about a father bear and his two very young cubs/humans. I was seeing the dream from the perspective of the eldest son. What bugs me a lot is it tended to switch a lot, the bears were humans, and then they were bears... At first there were the human father and his sons, in some remote area, in winter, when some bears came and started attacking them. One of the sons got away after seeing his father and brother get eaten by bears. But he kept getting hunted down, it's like the bears had a vendetta on him or something. So half of the dream this son was running from the bears, but halfway through it was like he was becoming a bear himself. Nobody in the villages he approached would let him in, or the bears would attack the people who tried to help him. Eventually he found a village he could get into, but they had no armed guards so he was afraid of what could happen to the people and that he'd get thrown out again anyway. That's where I woke up. There was a lot of running and hiding, but the pursuers always found the boy/cub from whose perspective I saw the dream. It felt like they enjoyed the hunt, that spreading fear and desperation was why they did this, not just finding food. There was also a lot of snow, and forests.","Seeing as the bears are all male it could be about masculine as opposed to feminine trait within. I'm thinking it might be thinking (masculine) vs feeling (feminine). So in that context the bear might be aggression in which case it might be avoiding running from feeling attacked by others aggressive opinionated stances. But that through this process you yourself are becoming aggressively opinionated, possibly in opposition to that opinionated stance that aggressively attacked you in the first place?"
"My dog was there.. she part away about 3 years ago and I absolutely adore her, even still, so if course I was ecstatic to see her. But something was off. She was missing part of her back two legs. She was able to move around just fine, but they looked almost like amputated human arms. I also remember at one point I left her (I vaguely remember being on a bus) and it seemed like no big deal but then it hit that she's gone and who knows when I will see her again, and I felt overcome with guilt and started justifying it to myself. For some context, I feel very guilty about her death...I don't want to get into the details, but she was only 7 years old and it was a freak accident but I didn't get her the help b she needed fast enough. I blame myself (yes, I know it's not healthy) and I miss her terribly every day. I try to stay positive and tell myself that I did the best I could for her at the time and she had a great life, but it's hard to shake the feeling that she should still be around. So the guilt of leaving her arms pretty on the nose. I'm mostly curious as to what the meaning might be about her legs.","The dog is missing a part of its legs which are more like human arms but also with parts missing. I think this dream is about your grief of losing your pet. It’s like you’re missing a part of yourself and seeing as you’re still separated in the dream, the dog is also missing a part of itself - you. The fact that it’s the legs suggests it’s hard to move forward some time. You’re handicapped by grief and maybe a bit of guilt. I’m sorry for your loss and hope you come to not blame yourself. I think this dream is a reflection of how you’re working through your feelings."
"I have had reoccurring dreams of two separate houses which are highly haunted by extremely hostile spirits, this started when I was about 9-10 years old, I am now 46, though they have slowed in how often I have them each week-month, one house I alway come across while hiking or being in a forest for some reason, this house is very old and like a massive dark two story wooden cabin that has a very large man who murdered his family and the nanny or house keeper, the spirits of the murdered always try to help get me away from him, the second house is also two stories, though sometimes it appears from outside in many forms ie one story, a care home, or even a rental of some sort, but once I enter it changes to ‘Her’ house. She is extremely violent and she drowned her children in the bath, she looks like the quintessential strict head mistress in this for, hair tightly pulled back in a severe bun and dressed in dark clothes, when I get past the bathroom I often end up in a guest like area with a kitchenette, her she is younger, dressed in a wedding dress and super super violent, the only way to get past her here is to dismember her, not an easy thing to do, as I have to get her parts away from each other or she re forms, sometimes she will appear walking down a grand staircase dressed in a beautiful red dress looking like she is going to a red carpet type event, she is blonde here and looking stunning, but their is always an air of malice about her. I came to an understanding with her after several years that if I don’t go up the stairs she leaves me alone, but sometimes in my dream I forget and then I have to fight like hell to get out and she appears in all forms throughout the dream trying to kill me until I get out","To me, this strikes me as you encountering your own strict/severe self, not necessarily in addressing others but I think more likely how you treat yourself, since she attacks you. It might be that you isolate this part of you, segregated from society hence in the ""wilds"". I also see it as a haunted part of you, hence haunted house. It sounds like the solution is segregation, separating the different parts of this character to deal with separately or something? Might be about taking on all your problems at once and then attacking yourself for not coping or something, when you should be separating your problems and dealing with them separately, something like that?"
A dream I had a few mornings ago..I was in this house that was empty except for a few items lying around the place..no furniture or anything as such lots and lots of empty space.. And then this girl came walking upto the house as I watched her through the window and then I woke up?,My guess is the dream symbolizes an emptiness you sometimes feel inside of you. The girl walking up may be the answer to that emptiness
"I had a great wonderful dream today about my grandma who past and in the dream she was walking around, and I was talking to my other grandma who's still alive and I had said to my other grandma yea I miss my grandma to she had a lime green nice suite on and she went in a classroom to ask a teacher about me my grandma that past right and as she was walking out that's when I told my other grandma she's walking around and so peaceful after talking to my teacher.. What does that dream mean?",Given the prominence of schools in the dream maybe it relates to learning. Maybe it relates to love in the universal love given green (the suit grandma is wearing) is based around the heart chakra and is an overall theme of the first dream at least.
"I dreamt I went back to complete high school. I attended with sons and daughters of friends I knew when when I was younger. Friends I would've graduated with had I not dropped out. The school was Purcell Marian and the tuition and expenses was paid for in full by the Leonard Nimoy Foundation. I was chosen because of my love expressed in the book I wrote dedicated to Coffey Dog and my friends. It seems someone sent the Foundation my finished book and nomination letter to the Foundation.. My book which never made it to stores or a decent publisher. For the reasoning by them there was to many other dog books out there on the market. Well it made its way then into most of the stores when I made it to the 10th grade a year later. I was able to keep humble and low key at school and never touched any profits from the book for a long time. Then I had set it up so I wasn't the only one who received its blessing. Those who helped me during my Coffey Years and recovery from his passing also got a share. I graduated with a B average or better from Purcell. Which meant Leonard's Foundation would continue paying for 2 years of a college of my choosing with room, board, simple expenses. Then somehow other places not known to me in the dream picked up another 4 years covered the same way.","Yes, very interesting. Maybe it is related to completing some rational based learning around love, friendship and expression (the book)? Like maybe expressing love is equally important to feeling it?"
I had a dream that my grandma was sitting at a kitchen table and I was in the kitchen with both of my parents arguing / talking back and forth. My grandma is quietly trying to say things to me but I’m almost ignoring her bc I don’t want everyone to know i can see her. My grandma passed 5 years ago. I talk to her sometime with ancestral alters. I haven’t used my alters or done magic for 5 months since I left a bad housing situation and had a really bad mental health time. My grandma was just sitting there looking at me and quietly whispering and I kept side eyeing her and looking away. I want to connect with her so badly. I wonder what she’s trying to tell me.,She’s just letting you know she’s still there - not gone anywhere is what I’m hearing x
"I was walking in the zoo with a previous relative that I don’t speak with in my waking life. She was a little girl in the dream. There was a dozen 20-30 ft snakes and tangled up. One saw as and attacked us. I was fine just panicking, she was bit and her ear was bleeding.",In the first dream I see a starting over of your relationship with your friend. That is why sha is showing up younger. The snake biting her symbolizes her getting over her issue that has kept you apart.
"I was with people on some secret mission. A mountain lion tried to attack us and ended up killing a woman I was with. I had to hide the remains and finish the mission. An ex I no longer have any communication with in waking life, later picked me up to take us out and woke up while I was mustering up the courage to tell him about it and I was nervous he was going to criticize me.",The second dream is you transitioning into something new. The other woman who is killed is an old aspect of yourself. The woman that is you is a new version of yourself. The mountain lion symbolizes the energy that came along and helped you transition. You have changed in a positive way and you don't want to tell your ex. It's about fully getting over him.
I feel like I was tipsy in the dream. And really hungry. I ate leftovers and was being all over some guy I was all over enjoying time with. I was having trouble chewing so I tried to rinse it down with pink lemonade. I reached in my mouth and it was a huge cockroach kinda pinkish tinted and it scurried away but I couldn’t stop screaming.,you are hungry is you looking for something new in your life. You are hungry for change after the mountain lion dream. The cockroach symbolizes good luck and prosperity is coming. It's a dramatic change. That is why you are fearful of it. The anxiety is attached to the changes that you are going through. You have learned a lot and you have earned the positive things coming. Face your fears and accept it.
"I dreamt that I was in a beautiful room, lots of light, wooden floors, on a bed surrounded with white sheets, very soft, i was with a man whose face I couldn't see, but he emanated this warm light. I was happy, and he kept touching my face in the most gentle way, It was a euphoric moment...His hands seemed familiar-like I've seen them before, but it seemed we were having an intimate moment as a couple, but then a child came running into the room and jumped on the bed with us and we were enjoyed a family moment. IRL I woke up feeling ecstatic,",This is symbolic of your parts of yourself in harmony. Awesome dream. Enjoy the moment.
"I had a dream or should I say “nightmare” of the man that molested me when I was around 5 yrs old. (He is now deceased) he was sitting on a recliner telling me to sit on his lap and I lost it. I was stabbing him over and over again. Yelling at him how he took my innocence and how he’s a pedophile etc. When I was done stabbing him I walked away and passed my parents bedroom. They were sitting up on their bed asking what had happened but never got up to check on me. I just walked away with blood on my hands hysterically crying. (Btw, I had dreamt with him years ago. He looked like a zombie and I forgave him).","Without looking up your symbols of the dream. Blood on the hands usually means a guilty feeling you are harboring. This dream might not necessarily be about this man in particular, it could be your subconscious way of making you listen to your inner emotions, knowing you will pay attention to this scenario a bit more."
"Last night I dreamt of my deceased pet dog. He is a white Lhasa. I saw my father was in the bathroom and he called me by my name to which I went there and saw my pet facing the bathroom door and barking. I called him by his name and he came running towards me and started to run all over the house from one end to another like he did when he was alive. Later I saw him bite my hand like he did and my father was squeezing his nose and he had tears in his eyes. The night before too, I saw I was bitten by a dog in my hand as well. It wasn't my pet.",One idea I have is that you’re worried about your fathers health and would like to get some relief from that. Another possibility is that your dog is representing a problem that you wish was in the past. Biting the hand could represent not knowing how to handle a problem; it may be a relationship problem that you feel some pressure on you to do something about. The dog running all around could be representing your thoughts going all around and not being able to settle.
"I had a dream about my both ex boyfriend and ex best friend? I was lying down with my ex boyfriend, I can’t remember quite what we were talking about but I felt like I was venting to him. It was weird that he was the one who popped up out of all my ex’s (personal opinion) because in all honesty I didn’t have the deepest of feelings while being with him. He was just a fun guy to be around, but since we didn’t see each other being long term, we cut it off in real life. My ex best friend and I were walking off our school bus. We haven’t talked in almost a year (in real life) and so in the dream she was curious about how I was doing regarding my ex (in the dream I think we were dating). Again, felt weird but relieving because I was just venting.","If you’re just venting, it could mean that the ex’s are representing that you wish whatever it is that you’re not happy about was all in the past and that you could feel it doesn’t bother you at all."
"I was in labor and I told the nurse that I had to push, I couldn't hold it any longer even though the nurse wanted me to wait. What came out was ""after birth"", even though my baby had not come out yet. The after birth came out first and the nurse put it in a bowl with a slice of pickle and told me to eat it, that it would nourish and strengthen me. I looked at the afterbirth in the bowl and it looked like pho noodles with a thin slice of beef. I thought maybe I could stomach it. I needed my strength. But, as I looked around me, there were people watching me to see if I would eat it and I became embarrassed and ashamed of myself. Like I wanted privacy to eat my afterbirth, but there was no privacy and I decided to just go for it. As soon as I ate it, I woke up.",This dream of giving birth is bringing something new into your life with this baby. You need to find some more inner strength to accomplish this. This is represented by you having to eat the afterbirth. This strength to bring this baby forward has to come from inside of you. This is all symbolic messages. The baby represents some you are trying to accomplish. You need to find the strength to do this.
"I am stood looking at 2 people that I know and are in my circle, they are crouched down to the floor whispering, they don't know I am there at first, one has their face turned away but I am clear on who this is, the other looks towards me with a mouth like the Joker.",That they are crouching below you is saying that they have lowered themselves in some way. You have kept your intention high in this situation. Things are going to be revealed to you about this. This is what it means when they turn to look at you. There faces tell the story.
"I had a dream that I was given a rose, it was open wide, I cnt remember who gave me it or anything else about my dream apart from being handed a rose","It would have a good meaning, maybe that you are blooming beautifully like a rose. It’s a feminine symbol."
"I’ve dreamed about a fish tank that got several fish in there. However, there is a fish that catch my eye. It’s like a goldfish but slightly bigger. It has a round mirror on its belly. When I look at the mirror, the mirror reflects? Or show blue cloud sky it was beautiful.","As water is featured in the dream, this is directly associated with feelings and relationships. The dream of fish can speak of your reality, real life and the actual emotions that you hold within. It may also foretell possible event's in your life that greatly concern your motional state. Mirrors provide us with a reflection and there presence in a dream may indicate that there is a need for personal reflection."
"I saw a few ants beside the pillow and when i lift the pillow i be saw more ants under it. I took the pillow and went out of my apartment to hit the pillow to dislodge the ants. The n i went back in the house. To my horror, the whole apartment floor was filled with ants! I could not even walk without stepping on ants! I even saw huge anteggs structures on the floor several centimetres high and half metres long.",These ants in your house represents yourself. This is some aspects of relationships or your own personal self. Take time for yourself. Take time to connect with those closest to you. This dream is saying pay attention. To wake up and change yourself so you are not overcome. You thought you took care of this symbolized by taking the pillow outside to knock the ants out. This is saying that you didn't do enough because when you go back in and the house is infested. This house represents your life.
"I had a dream that my buttocks are being exposed and down the ladder, I saw a few men who asked me to cover it. With that, I was known for my bottoms and all of them chased me in order to sexually abuse me. Afterthat, I saw a lady walked into my dream while I am being chased. I called my husband to rescue but she was so angry. She said she is going to beat me. With all of these confusions, I was so upset that I stabbed myself to death in a dream.",Death in a dream isn’t literal. It means big change . You could say it’s a ‘death’ of the old ways / habits/ thoughts. That you caused your death shows you’re ready to make the changes.
"Last night I had a dream about a boy named Nikko (I don't know anybody by that name) he was like a crazy boy early 20s he kept saying ""People know I'm crazy I leave guns everywhere"" I can't remember everything but that name stood out really vivid for some reason to me its been on my mind all day","The meaning of guns in a dream: (which I would focus on being the main symbol) A gun appearing in your dream is a direct manifestation of a worry from your waking life. This may stem from pride, or wanting to be superior. Alternatively, you need to feel protected, and his is what your subconscious came up with."
Yesterday night I dreamed of white swan in my arms and swan started cuddling me & rested on my neck & felt like she is calm. And when I woke up there is heaviness in my chest.,"The swan may have just introduced itself as your Spirit or Power animal. It may be signifying a dramatic growth in your intuitive nature. They are usually associated with the cycle of death and rebirth, and of course, love. What is your personal association with swans?"
"Lastnight I dreamt that hundreds of giant rainbow bubbles were dropping from the sky. They looked mesmerizing and beautiful, until they popped into giant demons that were coming to kill us all. I got into a large water spaceship with my many purple but couldn't find my daughter. I felt that I would die if I left the ship to look for her. I was with a lot of people I knew, and some family. Once in a while I would look out the giant windows and saw saucers flying around and killing the demons, and demons attacking our ships. Then this giant white robotic piston machine came and started helping us too. Meanwhile all this was going on, I kept trying to find a place to hide on the ship. My mother was there and I got into a physical fight and we both said we loathed eachother and I was fine with that. I was able to get away from my mother. Our ship started to fill with water then suddenly my daughter was on a flight of stairs and jumped off into the water towards me. I grabbed her and we both swam to a different part of the ship. I had a feeling of relief holding my daughter. I felt that we were going to die, but I felt peace with that.",The message that comes to me is “things aren’t always as they appear.” Water represents emotions. Could your mother and your daughter represent two aspects of yourself that you are trying to come to terms with?
I dreamed about seeing a white kitten with grey stripes on it the kitten was in my yard. I asked someone to pick up the kitten and gently put it on the other side of the fence. Can anyone help interpret this dream.,I see this dream as a desire to set a boundary within your life. The white kitten could represent many things. Possibly feminine energy.
"Dream that I was texting on my phone & caused a car accident. One minute I was texting, next minute I was laying on the ground, my vision was going black but I could see a lot of people standing around me. They were all looking around but I didn’t see anyone calling the ambulance. I was just laying stiff wondering if anyone was going to call them as I’m blacking out.",Symbolically it could be difficulty communicating on your life journey. It could also reflect real life concerns you have about texting and driving
"I’m having dreams about black cats which my grandma hated. I ownd horses but, when i went to fed them their hay they were under neath decomposed.","Cats symbolise female sexuality, and the black colour may mean it's hidden/'in the dark'. I'd have to know more content of the dream to say more though."
"My deceased mum was dying all over again, however she was vomiting blood and faeces, and it was also coming out the other end, I remember trying to clean her up and the woke up. Any idea what this means?","see this as a dream of purging. Your mum is no longer of this physical world, and maybe you haven't totally let go of her yet. Sorry for your loss."
"I dreamt that I was on a train going to Osaka, a super express train. I remembered that I had to go pick up a child so I got off the train and went to get the child in the opposite direction. But before I did someone asked if I climbed Mount Fuji and i said no because I am afraid of heights. I remember telling the train station staff “I need to get the child”. He told me “get on this train”, so I did. I remember something about beautiful little gold trinkets with very beautiful and interesting designs like nothing I’ve ever seen","You are experiencing a situation that is going out of hand, and you are feeling the need to protect or the need for protection. Your potential is getting blocked by an obligation. You got to trust the unknown to move forward."
"Hello everyone. I had a strange dream never had. I was sitting on the ground with a group of people. Seems like a picnic type of gathering. But there is a nice tablecloth on the ground and very nice silver cutlery with nice table setting. Under a white cloth napkin in addition to my regular cutlery, I find another set of silver cutlery under my napkin. We had a very nice time at this picnic","You have been having a busy life, the dream reminds you to relax."
"I had a dream me and another person was fleeing from something on horseback, I have no idea who the other person was because i never saw them in the dream but was talking to them and could feel their presence next to me on their horse. My horse was a black and white paint horse, we ride into a forest into an area we are not supposed to go, but there is a looming evil behind us, as we get deeper into the forest trail we are coming upon bodies of dead dogs and horses, and the foals of horses and very very large buffalo. The animals were not mutilated, or injured or looked as though they had been hunted the were simply dead and scattered about the forest trail. i decide to try and ride my horse out of the forest, and start to ride it up a hill, i can feel that it has started to get sick from the forest because it is growing smaller and turning into a large dog as i ride it up the hill, eventually it gets so small that I dismount and pick it up to carry it up the hill, now it has turned into a very small black and white deer type of animal, and i continue to carry it as it starts to fall apart and i walk out of the forest.",The trail represents a path that you are taking that may or may not be of your choosing. But it’s one you must take no matter how scary or difficult. The other person could be someone who will help you or it could be your spirit guide trying to help. Walking out of the forest shows you coming out of this situation safely and on your own.
"I had a dream with a famous last name in it... What does dreaming about a name mean... I really don't want to share the name... it's too devisive amongest people... In fact I really don't like the person, but it's not even the first time Iv'e dreamed about them... Is it possible to be connected somehow?","That person is serving as a symbol for you. Either the dream is saying to develop the characteristics of that person to help you in a certain situation, or it’s warning you not to be like that person. So it really depends on how you feel about this person."
"I had a dream I was getting ready for my wedding, to my current boyfriend. I was in a white ball gown type dress. I had friends and family around me helping me get ready. I was very nervous about saying my vowels in front of everyone, but overall a good dream.",would say desire to be married if thats something you're looking forward to in the future
I felt a tightness in my finger at first glance I worried it was a spider (wasn’t biting but applied pressure on y finger ) it wasn’t coming off and I then realized it was a bee (didn’t sting me) I pried it off to place it elsewhere There was a shallow hole in the ground and there was a fat fluffy bumblebee on its back very vibrant I saw it was among several ladybugs and my finger now free off the other bee Was dripping blood into the fluffy bright bumble bee That bumble bee was animated almost cartoonish and was smiling very happy and trying to catch my drops of blood. Overall the mood of the dream went from panic to confusion but I felt calm and pleasant at the end,My guess is the bee represents something in your life that used to scare or trouble you but no longer does because you have overcome it. The drops of blood represent the drain you used to feel dealing with this issue. I see it as a dream symbolizing success in your life.
"dreamt that my house was swarmed by leeches, bugs, all sorts of insects crawling on the walls. All green. What could it mean?","Hm, the fact they were on the wall of the house, could signify your skin. Perhaps your energy bubble around you has some energetic tears and you are leeching some energies so would need to repair them and strengthen it. All type of crawlers could also signify a heighten sensititivity as insects have some remarkable ways to sense their environment. Green is a healing colour."
So I had a dream last night where my fiancé and I are just hanging out and for whatever reason I decide to take a pregnancy test in the dream and it comes out positive.,The emergence of something new in your life. It could also symbolize the desire to have children with him
"I had a dream where this girl that in my dream was supposedly my friend. She gave me a hug and started crying because she predicted that I only have 3 months to live but she gave me a hug once more and touched my head and added, “ 3 months but it’ll continue… and will be given a chance” and she told me in the dream that when that time comes she’ll offer her life instead for me to live longer ☹️ and then I woke up.","Could it be a wish for a really good friend? Other than those ideas, I've got nothing."
"had quills, like a porcupine but much thicker, growing out of the left side of my face. I don’t remember much else about my dreams. Usually, they start off normal. I’ll be talking with family or others that I know and then something will happen and the wierd things begin. But that’s all I ever remember of them.",Were there any more details to the dream? Were you interacting with anyone else when the quills appeared? I would guess the quills could represent a defensiveness but because it is only on half your face you might be aware of appearing inconsistently to others.
