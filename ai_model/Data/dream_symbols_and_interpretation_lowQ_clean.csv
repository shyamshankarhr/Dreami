I was walking on some land, a vast area covered in green grass and some plains and some little hills/dunes looked like a valley. There was a lone tree. A big massive tree in distance. The leaves were all purple colour and it had some little white flowers. There was wind, not too strong, but the little flowers were flown away in the wind and falling like a flower rain. I was walking past the tree and I wasn’t alone but with someone. I don’t know who that is but someone close/familiar with. They gave me a flower that was caught floating in the air.

40,777843956533657,"So I woke up from a very strange dream. I often get very vivid dreams but this one was about my nan who has passed.it started very weirdly I couldn't keep up with what was happening like my dream was jumping from place to place.Then I remember speaking to who i believe was my partner when I got upset and said its Christmas we should be celebrating, dancing etc. He goes downstairs comes back and says right come on then let's go dancing. I get up walk to the staircase (it isn't my own it's a big fancy house , I only live in a small council rented property). I get to the top of the staircase look down and my nans there. I can see her talk to her and hug her! I'm very confused she passed why was she ther. In my dream state I knew that something wasn't right. Anyway we start walking to the pub it's in the middle of nowhere. Fantastic scenery surrounded by trees and views but the path is dangerous. Lots of cliff edges, deep slopes that sort of thing. My nan starts walking to the edges she's smiling and I'm scared she's going to fall. She says my name and just carries on. She falls off and lands on a larger person who breaks her fall and somehow they are both OK. She smiles and lends her hand as if to say I should take risks too its ok. I woke feeling like it was a message to stop letting fear control my life but have second guessed it thinking my nan didn't take risks why would she encourage me to in a dream ?

of animals and such, no NEW details or designs can be created basically, history and life repeat themselves until change is enacted). Therefore, it’s quite possible that because of the larger setting, environment of a big fancy house party and future, you dreamt of perhaps even a thought of living a different life than hers (including yours perhaps at the moment). She could be spiritually messaging you through the afterlife (dream medium) to tell you to take risks. This is similar to how she told you a permanent goodbye in the dream setting, yet you still saw her land safely on someone else and continue on? So basically, she’s telling you that goodbyes aren’t forever if you love someone, and to take advantages of opportunities while you can as ‘risks.’

By connecting logic with your subconscious, you are correct because you cannot just imagine something NEW or create something that you have not seen details of before. You are 100% in the acceptance&refl
ection stage of loss or life in general, thereby you have let go of her control/
influence, however you still love her and value her opinion.

Understand that the only thing stopping anyone from ‘letting go’ is themselves, you may love someone and not need to heed their opinions on your own entity.

Those last few lines are enough to show how you feel, you already understand that ‘you miss every shot you don’t take, but what does getting a shot mean to you?’ philosophy or mindset.",2022-05-08 10:40:47,319,340

The people were aspects of your deeper psyche you've accessed either as a response to a stimulus, or in alignment with a global phenomenon (spiritual ascension). These may be parts of your psyche that connect with the Collective Unconscious.

You faint when you hear a voice asking you if you're OK. This to me indicates ""finding"" the right ""self"" to fall back on.

He was a ""nurse"".. Very apt. Your New Masculine Energies from this quick shift are very healthy and ""healing"" for the Feminine energies that are wounded.

Hole in chest (Heart Chakra) is the ""sudden"" shift in consciousness I mentioned. It could be indicating the cause of this shift eg some emotional trauma etc but you have a very well grounded inner Masculine that is helping you ""heal"" (your power of discernment, responding instead of reacting, taking action with strategy, being responsible etc).

EDIT: Please look into breathing practices and kindly use them during Meditation.

I always suggest practicing Earthing and Grounding, and increasing water intake. These practices help us ""ascend"" more smoothly.

Ascension is linked with shadow-work. Shadow-work is linked with self-awareness.

Then we headed to see my partners family. I had a really large box with personal stuff in it, I can’t remember exactly what. I left it on the side of the road and throughout the day I went back and forth to it. The last time I went out to it, it was empty and I felt really sad about my things being stolen. I couldn’t remember what was in the box so I tried to just let it go and not be worried about it.

For context, in waking life my partner and I are going to her family’s place for lunch today for Mother’s Day.

1.) the ‘black wedding’ seems to be a passing, or some sort of afterlife meeting, like either you both met again in the afterlife or were accepting some sort of unchangeable loss/
experience.

2.) They’re close in age (fairly), probably were older or in their eternal/
spiritual form in their dreams and fought each other, or they fought as adults in their dreams lowkey LOL

3.) Since nothing else logically makes sense imma assume this is the brain connecting random uneventful things you saw and fused in your subconscious.

Since wedding is all black and you felt uneasy it can mean you are viewing this commitment as potentially bad. Your husband can be symbolizing something else like your logical side or even something you working. It doesn't necessarily mean anything about your relationship and probably has some other meaning. Two year old losing a tooth dream: it is natural for little kids to be losing teeth so I wonder what your feelings were about this. When we dream about losing our teeth as an adult it often has to do with feeling insecure about changes. A beaked red snake in a cage might have something to do with feing like you're holding back expressing anger but it's really difficult to say without more details as snakes can represent so many things and so can colors.,2022-05-07 17:42:17,187,157

Started crying n i stoped walking n put him on a seat standing so i can get more lved with him n i ask ""whats wrong?"" As i was thinking - how can you be in a place like this and be crying(because we were surrounded by tall trees and wilderness area where we lived in the town) - i asked 2 times before he answered, the first time he didnt want to say like his parents never wanted to hear him out n he looks down. I lift his chin up softly ""hey hey hey. . . look at me . . please"" i say softly and he looks at me n i let his chin go. ""What is wrong? Whats making you so upset? I really want to know"" I ask as we looked each other in the eyes. He seamed to calm down and says in a little bit of a whine ""Its boarding here and theres nothing to do. Its always the same"" i give a moment of silence before responding ""Ok how about this, when were done here i will play with you, anything you want. How about that?"" I asked n smiled being very caring about what i say which match my energy. ""Mhumm"" the kid responds with nodding. I smile at him happily ""When were done here well play ok"" i say and the kid calms down completely n nods i then picl him up.

I visit the town and I walk along the street with someone Idk (but do in this dream). I realise something is wrong and that all of the shops now have weird names. Still their names but either with a night/dream pun or some night/dream logo.
The person idk (Let’s call him P, I guess) sat on a bench and I ask them wth is going on, they confirm it was my town but that it’s called Whoville now. Very confused, we walk into this shop. The manager is walking around shouting ‘Make sure […] don’t fall asleep in my shop!’. Some guy looks drunk and as if he’s going to fall asleep. P helps him out of the shop and he’s grateful.
Soon after, the shops begin to close and the place looks dark and gloomy. All the shops looked as if they were abandoned. Broken windows, lights, and cafés had food laying around. People walking around went into different shops. A group of women were in this café next to me and began eating. Quickly, they all collapsed. P complains that this is just like ‘so and so shop’ and that people just shouldn’t take the risk anymore! I quickly realised that they were all dead.
(For some reason) I and P break the windows of a real estate shop and see this very old, short man with black hair and small glasses. He wore old fashioned but fancy clothes. We talk to him for a bit, ask him questions etc. Turns out that you can either leave your shop in view or hide it. If you leave it in view you can leave a light on to let people know […]. He said that it was stupid and he would never do that. He continues to talk and I look over to see candles lit at a window. I quickly blew them out so that he wouldn’t notice. They came back.

The town and he all had to escape the cavern and he begged the girl to come. He dragged her up all the scaffolding with the town.

***
Shops are essentialy symbols for people.
When we come to earth we do so to pursue our purpose, develop and embody our gifts which we offer to each other hence the shop reference.
The manager usually refers to brain, so the brain is preoccupied with keeping the body alive (ie not falling asleep which effectively means to die in dream language)
P (this is probably your teaching guide) in the dream helps someone out of the shop - meaning helping someone cross over back to the spirit world. This is very important spiritual assistance and I believe the dream is telling you you can do this also.
People (souls) then go to another shop, meaning another incarnation.
When the shop closes (meaning the consciousness leaves the body), place looks dark and gloomy.
Reference to food/death (reminded me of artist Lyubov Panchenko death in Ukraine)

The second part whereby you have a choice to leave your shop in view or hide it, looks like a choice to offer your consciousness, light to others as a support when crossing over - like a 'ferry men'. You can do that during nightime sleep (with conscious commitment before going to bed).
But it seem there is warning that this entails travelling to places where death is present (war zones, nursing homes, hospice etc) which could have certain impact on a being.
Hiding the shop, replacing the windows with wood would be shielding away from this (protection boundaries). Window usually refers to clairvoyance /third eye, so that would be shut.
It s a deep dream and I suggest you ponder on the messages it s giving you especially since you had a similar dream before. Let me know if this makes sense.",2022-05-07 00:00:00,834,349

You can't be with her in real life, so your subconscious compensates this by allowing you to spend time with her in your dreams. It is sad when you wake up and find she's not really there, yeah. At that point, I think it will help to just cry it out. The dreams themselves are actually trying to help you process your emotions, because you're not processing them enough in real life. Instead of trying to stop it, it might be better to appreciate what it is trying to do for you. Thank your dream for allowing you to spend time with her. And for helping you process your feelings for her.

Add:
I'm also getting the sense that there is something you really regret. For one, it sounds like you regret not trying to be romantically involved with her. Two, that you two lost contact.

My Dream.
I was in an apartment and in this dream, it was my apartment. I was with my kids and my daughter was watching something on TV. Then the front door opened, and I became afraid and then just felt anxious. I froze. I was shouting “get out, get out.”

I ran to the door, but I felt like I was going in slow motion. I pushed the door closed, locked the top and bottom nob. I even hooked the chain, but I had the sense…this feeling like I was doing something wrong. That I should not have been locking whoever it was out. I know it was a man behind the door. I heard the locks turning…he had a key like he had belonged there. He walks through the door. It felt like this was his place as well, I deep down kept saying get out…out…but I stood there staring at him. Like I was waiting for something. I felt like I was waiting for him to hold me. But I was frozen. He had black hair. I felt that I knew him, but he was a blur. I could not see his face. He stood there as if it was his home, it was our home. I looked at him like I didn’t know who he was, but I knew who he was, and I wanted to him to be there and hold me, but I kept thinking…Go…cause they always leave.",2022-05-06 06:29:26,0,1,1416474718874182,100023865227789,"The dream is showing you the truth of the matter, you’re afraid he will leave so you want to protect yourself by not caring.

I feel this dream is a call for you to come into yoyr power.

The warrior is an archetypal figure that many of us dream of. He is the hero found in many stories. Brave, bold and confident. Able to tackle life's challenges and push through against all obstacles and opponents. He fights for truth, he stands against all that is ""bad"" in this world and stands up proudly for what he beleives is right.

The dream calls you to be the warrior in yoyr own life.

Living in the wild is about finding yoyr own sense of authenticity. To be who you are in your most natural state. Being unafraid and unashamed in your own sense of self, that who you are, what you beleive on and how you want to show the that to the world.

As you move into the position of the wild authentic warrior you may come across those who wish to attack you, to see you fail or knock you down. Because they themselves are challenged by your sense of pride and confidence in who you are. They will not want you to change, to move away from their controll or beleive about who you are or who you should be.

The gnomes show that you feel yourself to be ""bigger"" than them. They are no real threat to you when you stand in yoyr power, but they can cause some trouble so best to keep your distance. I feel you have given these people a taste of yoyr new found strength and confidence, but you do not seek to really hurt them.

"" I really tried to become more ruthless but it was hard"" I feel this is true of yoyr life right now. It is hard to move away from compliance and move towards agency. You do have to be ruthless, you have to put yourself and your own needs first.

I feel the baby shoes on the ground are a symbol of the immature steps you have taken in life on the road to maturity. Perhaps in the past others have had to clear up after you If you have made any bad decissions etc. Perhaps there is some clearing up for you to do now as you learn to deal with your own affairs. Once you have everything in order you will be better able to meet your own needs.

One idea to consider, others might offer alternative suggestions.",2022-05-04 00:00:00,156,455

So i have this fresh milk in the bottle and i got it from someone who claim its good quality. However (and for unknown reason) I've got the sudden feeling that this is not a pure milk but instead, a poisonous one. But even though i had that weird thought, I still bought it from the store because a friend of mine suddenly showed up and i dont want her to question the store's credibility too.

After buying the milk and losing my friend from the mall (since she also have errands to do), i quickly lined up on this another store and asked them to clean the bottle of the milk and scan the beverage for its ingredients or content. Suddenly, this friend of mine also popped up in this store and this time i have the feeling that she's suspicious of the milk's content too. Apparently when the lady that scanned the milk came back, she said that it's 90% milk content so, I quickly reasoned myself out to my friend and said that I just wanted to get the bottle cleaned but deep inside, I still doubt this and thought that I'll just throw it out once im home.

After exiting the mall and while walking down the street, i sensed this one man looking suspiciously at us. I grabbed my friend's hand and pulled her to walk faster and exit these streets but more numbers of men got up and chased us.

Weird and gross, somewhat sexual in nature dream

My sister got surgery to turn her tongue into a penis. We were sitting in the car me and her in the backseat while my husband was driving. I kept wondering if she can taste anything now since she doesn't have any taste buds. And also if she regrets it. because it's a life long alteration to her body. I for some reason said to her. I guess your transgender? And she said no she's still a girl. And then I agreed since I guess it's only her tongue. And for some reason she ended up jerking off her tongue in the backseat of the car while I was there and hubby driving. But it was a literal explosion of cum after. I was so grossed out. Cause she had came all over me and some got in my mouth. And I got mad and said. That it was unconscentual sperm or something.and then got napkins to clean up.

Then we went to this place and my sister came with us. But she kept poking Out her dick tongue and I kept telling her to put it away, there could be children. Then she kinda disappeared. Me and my husband were having alot of fun and I was telling him we should come here more often. Things we're closing up and so we were getting ready to go, I went over to the trash to take gum out of my mouth, but for some reason no matter how much gum I took out of my mouth there was always gum in my mouth. Until there was a huge pile. And even then I still had gum so gave up. Which sucked cause the gum didn't even have flavor anymore and was gross.
I went to look for my sister and in one area there was a bunch of different displays, like museum artifacts. And I kept spinning this movable display and then all of a sudden I seen my sister dead in the case. It was more a flash of her head, and then this weird objects that symbolized her.

I open it up and look down, it's endless flights of stairs. The stairs are narrow but covered in the same coloured velvet, I start my decline and every so often I come to a platform thats a jump away from the stairs. It's like a viewing platform that has a door with lights on either side. I didn't want to jump over onto it to see what's behind the door. I continue down and finally the stairs leads me to a door, I open it and it's a room that has a musical instrument in it, I can't quite remember what sort but it was a magical one that would start playing. I walk across the room to the door infront of me and open it and its like I'm back at the beginning, it's more endless flights of stairs.

So this is two separate dreams, 2 days in a row.

Im inside my house and I see masked figures outside slamming into the windows of my house. Over and over again. I was so mad a found a large stick/staff and went outside to find them hiding around the side of my house. It was an inspector I sometimes use (who I get along great with) and a few others I did not recognize. I was very dissatisfied and upset and threatened to hurt them and they left after I shared my distaste.

The next day I was in my living room and noticed water damage coming through all of the walls/ceiling (some context last year we had some water leaks and it left our house cut open for the better part of 8 months waiting for contractors that in itself was a nightmare) as I looked closer at the walls I noticed they almost looked like they were molding or looked very old and cracking with scars on the walls, I looked up to the top left and there was a large, almost demonic alien full head/face imprinted in the wall, like as if the face was inside the wall pushing out. It had a very large cranium and smaller mouth comparable to an alien, this shit was scary looking. To my wife I said wtf is that! I then noticed halloweeny decorations all around the house and at that point I lost it and said babe did you put these decorations up?? She said no. All of a sudden a giant owl flew smacking straight into the window glass with force, I immediately ran outside to find I was in a cul de sac and the owl was hanging in front of the window connected to a long clothes line that was attached to a home across the street.
I was so pissed and as I walk up to the house, the same people from the dream before came out with masks holding swords and approached me, I was able to disarm a sword from one of the three men, this time I didn’t recognize any of them. I realized the swords were wooden, then I remember waking myself up yelling we need to lock the doors.

Last night, I dreamed that one of the students who’s 11 years old and I went on a roller coaster only the seats were more like a chair lift. It took us up, up, up and then when we reached the top, we slid into a house. There was a woman who lived there. She fed us tomato soup for lunch and my student got it all over his shirt. The woman brought him another shirt and said she had a son by the same name who passed away a few years before and she hadn’t been able to get rid of his things. His name was written on the tag of the shirt. My student put on the shirt and we then left to go home. 🤷🏻‍♀️",2022-05-04 18:59:52,0,1,1415394328982221,100023865227789,"How you feel about this particular kid is probably important.

be a belief that he could do it.

329,1650550307,Okay… that was a weird dream.. I somehow pulled a bone out of my nose. It looked like a thin chicken bone not an actual nose bone. But I was babysitting and I had the kids drive me to the ER and the dr took a knife and and peeled back my skin to put the bone back. I was awake. It was the strangest feeling/ dream I’ve had. After like 10 minutes of the dr digging around to put the bone back up there I woke up bc my conscious was like get me tf out of here lmfao 🤣,2022-05-04 19:06:06,0,1,1414554759066178,1317912160,"Weird dreams are the best, lol. I think your dream could be that you were looking at the ""bare bones"" of your feelings as nose can equate to intuitive sense. That the bone looked like a chicken bone might be examining your fears more closely. Maybe getting the bone put back in after digging around might be you found your feelings were warranted after you really delved into the matter. That's my guess but there can be many interpretations

331,950568728894965,"Hi. New to the group. I had a dream that has been bothering me.

Background: I dated someone in 2015. The person broke up with me out of nowhere, when things were going pretty well. Over the phone, mind you.

We were both young and this person wasn’t ready to settle down. This person was perfectly decent and I cared for them a lot, at the time.

I was heartbroken, but I moved on.

This person reached out to me in 2016 to apologize, but I immediately cut them off, and respectfully told them I was doing great, had moved on and wasn’t interested in their apology, friendship or otherwise. I wished them a beautiful life, sincerely and wholeheartedly.

Fast forward to last week. This person comes to me in a dream.

We are in the same place, they wave at me to get my attention.

I tell them “Hi, nice to see you but I can’t talk. I’m late to pick up my kid from daycare.”

They keep saying something I can’t understand, and I’m in a rush and get to my car. I then find the car has been hit / is dented and the tires are flat. This person is gone and I’m stuck there.

*I wake up.*

The next morning, out of curiosity, I type their name on Facebook and after some digging, I find out they died unexpectedly last summer. Young, seemingly healthy person. Poof gone.

Now, I’m here feeling sad and spooked.

Any interpretations? Thank you!",2022-05-02 07:26:25,0,2,1412274292627558,100023865227789,"In the dream you’re rushing and feeling like it’s too late to stop and listen to what someone has to say to you.

I was hit in my left thigh. I was then taken to a field doctor to stitch me up. While waiting for the doctor I was able to pull out 2 bullets on my own ( they were .22 c) and then the doctor walked in while I was doing so and just laughed and jumped in to finish. He retrieved 3- .45 c bullets. He cleaned me up, we spoke about the strangeness of the 2 different caliber of billets and then I woke up. Any thoughts?",2022-05-04 15:24:28,0,1,1414458749075779,1317912160,My guess is you foresee that you might need to rescue yourself from something in the future. However you aren't fearful about or afraid of being wounded. The bullets might represent what is wounding you. The different caliber bullets might be symbolizing some wounds are more significant than others. The numbers associated with the calibers could be significant to the dream meaning. Two might be related to a partnership. Four symbolizes stability and 5 is the number of change and freedom. You might feel that while you are capable you might need some professional help to heal/move past some of those wounds.,2022-05-04 00:00:00,136,111

But last night's dream did. I really hope someone can help me figure out what I'm supposed to know. Here's the dream:

I was somewhere, a house maybe, with my husband getting ready to leave so we called an uber. The car came and the driver seemed a little nervous. I just figured he was a new driver. I got in and my husband hadnt come out yet.

I dream that I’m back in my childhood bedroom. It’s not the only bedroom I had in childhood, but it is the one in the home we shared with him, and the room I had through my most formative years. The room is barren, but I’m painting it a baby blue color. Suddenly I notice he’s in the room with me; I’m not sure when he came in, but when I turn around he’s painting over my blue with a dark red. I start screaming “Stop! Can’t you see I’m trying to paint it blue? Why can’t you see that? Stop!” He ignores me, and suddenly the bat I used to play softball with in the time I lived there is in my hands. I start hitting him with it, and I’m crying and saying “Please stop painting it red, I’m trying to paint it blue.” I can feel the resistance of my bat hitting him, I’m swinging as hard as I can, but I never see it hurting him. He continues to standing facing away from me as I hit him.

And that’s where the dream always ends and I wake up having cried in reality during my sleep.",2022-05-02 10:01:23,2,12,1412062022648785,560345596,"Hi, firstly I am so sorry this man hurt you and that you are still suffering in this way.

My thoughts are that the dream is calling you to do some further work.

Being in the room you shared tells me that the dream is about the mindset you occupy around this issue.

There are allways many threads to the symbols and lots of different ways to approach them. My interpretation is just one suggestion.

It seems the room has been cleared in preparation of remodelling and renovation. Your psyche needs an update in some way.

Yet you used the word ""barren"" so it may also be that this space internally has become a barren and empty place for you. I wonder if you have tried to clear away the issue in some way, or you just want to paint it over and cover up what happened. Maybe that's something you tried to do when you were young.

Baby blue suggests an innocence. A colour we might paint for a new baby's room. Blue is the colour of the throat chakra, the centre of ouf communication, it invites us to talk and express ourselves, especially verbally. It's also a colour of peace and tranquillity.

I feel that the painting is a way of saying i want to start again. I want to prepare for a new beginning, to clear away the old and welcome in the new. The colour is ""light"" and invights those themes too.

But the man seems to have too much power because he is allways able to undo your efforts. Red is a very emotive colour bringing thems of lust, passion, danger and anger.

I feel the scene is describing what occupies your mental space over the issue. It seems he is still able to take over and ""colour"" things. Im sure this experience in many ways has ""coloured"" or informed the rest of your life, perhaps with a darkness.

Your asking him to stop is very possative because you recognise the unwanted and ongoing influence in your life.

But your pleas and physical attempts to make it stop are not working. And I feel this probably the crux of it. It's very very sad and unfair, this man violated you when you were a powerless. He broke the law, the trust of your family and broke every sacred boundary that is held by good decent loving people. The softball racquet I feel represents your efforts as a child who mearly did not have the power to make it stop by her own efforts. That was not your fault and I feel the dream is repeating because it wants to call you forward as the adult you now are. It's replaying this internal video because its still playing out in various ways within you. You need to address the issue to get the dream to change and hopefully stop.

If this were my dream I would look towards finding a good psychotherapist
and begin by bringing them the dream. There is obviously a lot of pent up emotion that is being held within you.

The painting shows that you want to start over. Painting your own childhood room and the location of your pain, suggests you want to welcome the child who you were.

I see the painting of the room as you setting out your life and goals and making plans for what your life will look like. Him painting over your blue I think represents how his actions have changed the colour of your experience. I think the meaning of the colours is significant too, blue being a safe and peaceful colour vs the red representing violence and anger and negativity. Your act of hitting him not affecting him I think probably represents your retaliation to the trauma he put you through and feeling like even if you fight back it’s not going to be effective. I think the reason you’re having this dream is to process the loss of childhood and innocence and control over life.

above are beautiful. I think this sounds useful, what has been said. To add to this is the dream image of a bedroom can mean one's own privacy, one's own unconscious, and one's view of sexuality. Which he has given you a darker view of these things than you naturally would have. Softball means you are not ""playing hardball"" you do not feel that you were tough enough about what happened to you.

I am going to make a suggestion of what to do which was advice my mother gave to me when I was a child and would have the same nightmares over and over.

She told me, before I go to sleep, to tell myself about the monsters ""i am not afraid of you!"" She said if anything is chasing you in a dream, to turn around and face it ""you don't scare me, you can't hurt me, I am not afraid of you!"" And it will be less scary once you face it. I think this is true in waking life working through c-ptsd triggers, and it is true in dreams as well.

If you keep hitting him with the bat in the dream, see if you can try having any awareness in the dream that you can try something else. You could try ""this is my room. You are not allowed in here""

Or simply ""you don't hurt me, you can't scare me, I am not afraid of you""

Because he turns his back on you in the dream, and because also about how others commented on ""painting over"" can mean to try to cover or conceal the surface, it makes me think that the dream is about ""facing him""

You can do this in a dream, by looking into his face and telling him ""you can't hurt me anymore I am not afraid of you""

But as mentioned, you can do this in therapy or journaling.

There is an option where you could ask a therapist about ""role play"" the idea of the therapist standing in for this abuser while you tell him what it is you need to say to him.

You can also do this with mental rehearsal of conversations and or with letters

A ""confrontation fantasy"" which is either imagined, or played out in therapy, or that eventually actually happens in real life - this is a huge part of healing from sexual abuse 💖

Much love to you in your healing journey 💙💜 the fact that you are having the dream is showinghow strong and resilient that you truly are, that you are recovering and gaining strength and working through this. It sounds like you are at a close point to having a breakthrough and that's why your mind is nudging you with these dreams

It was like I was back in another time and men were very domineering over women, it seemed like the men were treating their women like slaves and they were getting paid for it, like a pension. Even though the men were working, they were getting some extra cash from the government for having a wife but the women were unaware of this injustice. It was like they were imprisoned in their own homes.
So I walked into a house and started demanding that the women be set free and aware of what was going on. It wasn’t about breaking up a marriage, it was more about giving them some freedom, I just sensed a mass injustice. This guy was trying to overpower me so I basically told him I will absolutely beat the crap out of him if he keeps doing this. He was being a smart arse so I grabbed him and started punching him in the face and then his wife was free.
I then followed her and then we kissed.

Next moment I was somewhere looking at some cycle, like it was repeating itself and I said to my son about things never change! I wish I could remember the details more but it was like I kept seeing the same things

I was at my house after work with friends hanging out. There was string in one of their hairs, so I started pulling it out. Then, her hair started coming with it. It was like 3 feet of her hair, although it wasn't that long. We talked about how weird it was, but didn't think much of if.i asked if I should just throw it away, admiring how soft and thick it was.

As the vehicle approaches and stops, I get a weird feeling and quickly throw the hair in the trash. My friend was sitting on the front stairs of the porch, and I was right inside the door with the other friend in the kitchen. .

I've asked him to leave again, but doesn't and is closer. I have it ready to go and pointed. As my friend asks if I'm OK, I said yes and the accidentally pulled the tri.g.g.er kill ing him .

We’ve “baby danced” twice since the bleeding stopped. I felt a tiny bit of cramping yesterday. Maybe ovulation?

I've had many dreams where there's no way my subconscious could possibly know what is going to take place yet it happens. This one dream I can't seem to shake.

I died in my sleep. I was a spirit. There was someone talking to me. I don't recall seeing what it looked like. The feeling I had is so hard to describe as I've never felt something like it. There was no pain, no worrying, no fear. Just calm, relaxing and pure peace. I don't feel like my description justify how wonderful it actually felt. The voice asked if I was ready to move on. I stated back that I'm going to stay here with my children. Weather I'm alive or a spirit I'm not going to leave them. I will stay with them to help them through their lives. When they have children I will be here for them too. Shortly after this I woke up. The feeling of complete peace lingered in my body. I was happy, relaxed and calm when I woke up. It was such an incredible feeling.

Even though I don't have any beliefs of what comes after death, I'm not scared of death. So I know my dream is not a fear of me dying. I have searched for a meaning and anything I come across, I'm not able to relate to. I do question if I agreed to move on if I would have actually died.

Part of this is because we stayed in the relationship, so we were accepting those comments, in some way, it got internalized, like ""maybe their criticisms are correct""

I think if your ex shows up in your dreams, it is a symbol of someone you KNOW not to listen to, you KNOW is negative and doesn't want the best for you, you KNOW you want this negativity out of your life.

Therefore, if your ex shows up in dreams complaining about you, it can be a sign of:

1. In waking life, you are being accepting and welcoming of someone else's negativity. You can find a way to cut this down or to stand up for yourself, if you have this situation to deal with

2. That you have been having negative thoughts about yourself, and you know those aren't true, so it is time to cut that out and be lovelier and sweeter to yourself 💜

My two cents Ali Pinlac it doesn't mean this person is coming back in your life, it means they represent a symbol of criticism which you know is overly harsh, and something in your waking life is reminding you of that.",2022-05-02 00:00:00,131,255

454,100001910106393,"I apologize if this is long, but i need to give a back story for ppl to really understand. Let me start by saying, I am 51 yrs old now. Many yrs ago, my family lived in a neighborhood with alot of kids. We only lived there for 2 yrs and during that time, I was 14 and 15 yrs old. There was a boy who had a huge crush on me, I will call him john. I was a bit of a tomboy and i didn't have the same feelings for him. To me he was just a friend. He loved hanging out with me so he accepted being just a ""buddy"", tho i knew his feelings were deeper. We were together all the time for 2 yrs, then we had a bad argument and i wouldn't hang out with him anymore. Shortly after, we moved from there and i never saw him again. But everytime i ran into to ppl from the neighborhood, they would tell me how devastated he was. Even adults told me he must have been truly in love with me, even at such a young age. Now fast forward, all these decades later, I have started having recurring dreams about John. For several months now, at least 3 times a week, I dream that we run into each other and we are sooo happy to have found each other again. In the dreams, we are both willing to leave our current partners and do whatever it takes to be together. The real strange thing is...when I wake up, I am very sad and disappointed that it was just a dream! I wake up feeling like i have lost something very special in my life. Let me add that i am happily married to my partner of the last 10 yrs. I hate to sound cold, but at the time john and i parted ways all those yrs ago, it seemed insignificant to me. I had no romantic feelings for him then, so why in the world would i have them now? Or perhaps the dream isnt really about john, perhaps he represents something else? Any insight would be appreciated, and sorry it was so long. Lol",2022-05-02 19:22:14,1,1,1412455959276058,1317912160,"He is probably an Animus figure, or your inner masculine part.

I had a dream about twin biracial girls . They were absolutely beautiful around the ages of 10 years old. They had blue eyes and I can remember myself trying to see if I recognized their energy. While the girls talked to me, I noticed they were both extremely different. I can remember talking to them and one of the girls talked about how she was connected to her roots, and although she was biracial she didn't feel any connection to her European side.She identified herself as Black. The other twin explain that she was well connected to her European side and also said she wanted no parts of her African Ancestry Side. This twin identified herself as White . They were both sweet girls , but I reiterate they're completely different. This dream felt real, but I don't understand it.Im not European, however I have European relatives down the line.

It could be to do with your behaviour in regards to how you move forward in life. That may or may not also have ties work and career.

Something about your teenage self is obscuring your outlook and your view is broken in some way. Think about how old the teens were in the dream and what was going on for you at that age. If it were my dream I would be looking for my own behaviours then and seeing what traits I still hold.

It may be the ""I don't care"" is an arrogance you hold, this could be a reactionary habit formed at that time in order to self protect.

I feel that the confrontation is about looking at yourself and confronting the issue. What has been broken within you and what is responsible for that damage? How have the events of your teenage years damaged your ability to move forward with clear sight.

I feel the need to contact the parents suggests that you would like your own parents or upbringing to take some responsability for the damage.

The manager is you and your own internal management system. It may be that you have a lot of repressed anger and rage carried forward from that time. The ""I don't care"" might be an attitude formed though not being able to change a situation. Sometimes if we have no agency we detratch or disassociate as it's the only option we have at the time that allows us to escape and avoid facing the emotions we have.

This is one possible interpretation.
Others might offer alternatives of course.",2022-05-02 00:00:00,161,304

I entered the house and started turning on lights as it was getting dark quickly. I went to the back door to find a black bear napping in what looked like a large mud room. The pets inside the house were all panicking.
I tried to secure the house but the black bear found a way in through a door I didn't know about.

Suddenly there was ice everywhere and we were all trapped on a set of metal stairs leading up to the flight deck. It was freezing and we couldn't move. I began to sob hysterically and dropped to the floor that was icy cold.

There is a situation that you feel could be devastating and explosive but actually is less volatile than you imagine. Though It still causes major emotional disruption and obstacles in your life.

My thoughts are that you feel very vulnerable as you try to navigate the repercussions of this event, you would like to escape but you are unable.

I feel the ice represents frozen emotions. A feeling of being stuck and unable to find releif or release. You would like to move on or make changes but you are potentially afraid I feel. You perhaps are unable to let your true feeling be known. I wonder if this is related to yoyr relationship in some way. I feel internally you are being overwhelmed by your emotions, you want the situation to end but you feel unable to act, and this is very difficult for you. I feel the random man is your own thinking/

When things are going realllly well we tend to think “ok, where’s the catch? what could threaten this good thing I’ve got going?”. I’d say you should take a day with each person involved. Plan some fun actives, or just hang out and talk. Confiding in each other about your lives, worries, and feelings might restore the sense of security and trust.

This happens if we have a bunch of unresolved issues or trauma that bogs us down, and we find ourselves defensive or triggered often by daily occurences, we cannot respond to these with openness or full responsiveness,
because we have shut ourselves down due to the fight, flight or freeze reaction. (I more and more think that the key to unconscious/
consciousness exploration is linked with parasympathetic
nervous system response. And that neuroscience is finding out what religion has said for a long time - that love is consciousness, the higher path, awareness.... it is only when we feel the safety of being loved that we can actually open our awareness with our higher faculties...)

And so many are stuck in this trap. Or puzzle or maze like an escape room. It is like a trap, because interestingly, we cannot truly figure out this unconscious reactivity this defensive triggered survival mode while we are actually in it. Neuroscience is saying this too. That you feel safe again first. THEN look at understanding the trigger.

But first, get out of the hole you are in, to see from a wider perspective.

Often, we get trapped in the survivalist mode because we try to figure it out from within that survivalist mode. For example, someone who feels triggered by another's behaviour might then identify that behaviour as the cause of the trigger. But this doesn't actually go very far in understanding, overcoming, or resolution. It merely cements the knowledge that the world is unsafe and that we have to have our defenses up instead of trying to find common ground.

The tunnels I think are a metaphor similar to the ""trances"" they often talk about in the new age (and sometimes psychology). The auto pilot mode, that is living unconsciously, without conscious awareness and choice making.

""Tunnel vision"" is seeing only the narrowest path in front of you and no way out. This can be like depression ""a long dark tunnel"". Tunneling into something also in a more positive way can be about obsessive focus on figuring out the originating path of some particular behavioural pattern. Sometimes I think we do have to delve deeply into an obsessive thought on a specific topic in order to understand that pattern in our life. But, as in your dream, the idea is to recall you are not just in a negative obsessive circular thought pattern. But that instead you are ""tunneling"" up and out, in order to find the secret way to unlock this particular unconscious behavioural pattern, to crack the code, to be able to stop unconsciously repeating it.

Dance here can also be synonymous with that ""trance"" metaphor. Here, the struggle to find meaning of the unconscious while staying submerged in the unconscious.

""I was never good at that dance anyway, I gave it up when I had a family""

The defensive survivalist mode was never appealing for you to be stuck in, and having a family moved you further out of that.

Which makes sense to me. To consciously choose to have a family, it requires a huuuuuggggee amount of hope and faith and optimism. AND a longer view. AND a broader understanding of the self, knowing that the lower self for example immediate needs is not the whole self, which allows one to have more patience and delayed gratification, more giving. Because you can think of not just the immediate self, but also the past and future selves, a very expansive view of self that takes us out of immediate reactivity and makes us look at a wider overview.

Also though, the larger view of self and how that links with starting a family is the selfless love of having a family. That our wellbeing is now so palpably connected to ensuring the wellbeing of our family. It is a reminder we are not just alone, selfishness is very very narrow of a view.

As I said above, I think neuroscience (for example Stephen Porges polyvagal theory) is just telling us now what ancient religion and philosophy has also said. Agape love is the answer to consciousness. Giving it and receiving it opens the pathways.

Pathways here also are figurative, as in changing behavioural patterns in life through increasing overview and wider awareness. But also literal - opening and strengthening new pathways in the brain to form connections that used to be dead ends or circular thought patterns before.

Your mind may have been trying to tell you that you need to cut him out of your life, or let it go. The reason he may have changed to a different person in the end could be that you don't really want to hurt your brother at all, just the part of him that is doing bad and irresponsible things. That person could represent someone who has influenced or encouraged his negative behaviors in the past.

I'm so sorry you had such a horrible dream. It's scary when your subconscious shows you images you would never actually do in real life, but remember our dreams typically are not literal. It's all imagery and symbolism interpreted from memories and experiences in our past. I hope your dreams are better from now on. 💚",2022-05-01 14:52:41,173,156

676,100000232635256,"The other night I had an awesome dream.

I wasn’t myself in this dream, I was a small, translucent, slime ball lol. I was super bouncy and could just bounce all over the place

The scene of the dream was like a video game level, I was contained in a giant cube-like area, and it was full of beautiful bright colors like purple, magenta, teal, and white. Super happy looking. There were tall platforms for me to jump onto and certain areas had little trampolines which would make me jump even higher.

In this it was exactly like a video game, I was trying to hop away from the enemy chasing me, I was having so much fun even though I was a bit scared to get caught! In order to stay ahead, I had to try to jump on the trampolines only so I could jump faster and higher each time. At one point I accidentally landed on flat tile (looked like bathroom tile, it was shiny and cold and I still remember how it felt landing on it) and I sort of just splatted on it and didn’t bounce. I had to shimmy my way back to the trampolines to bounce again, I was super close to getting caught by the enemy, but still got away!

685,653990550,"Hello! I am seeking insight into my dream. I dreamt that it was night. I was sitting on the passenger side of a vehicle that was parked in front of a house that was recently purchased by someone I knew in my dream. It appeared to be a really nice move-in ready home, however, upon close examination, I could tell that the home was not habitable. The roof was incomplete as I could still see its trusses. It was evident that the home had been assembled quickly without regard. There was a non-occupant vehicle parked next to the vehicle that I was in. Despite the vehicle being new, there were visible scratches. Suddenly, the vehicle that I was in started to roll backwards. I struggled to stop the vehicle, but managed to figure it just moments prior to it rolling in the street . The vehicle's interior was quiet unique, and not at all what I am accustomed to. I couldn't figure out how to drive the vehicle forward towards the house. My husband came along to explain a few things about the vehicle. The dream changed and I was now sitting in the rear. There was a woman sitting in the driver's seat. Without warning the woman transformed into a dark green lizard. I was so frightened that I ran out of the vehicle. I started swimming through the air (a common occurrence in my dreams).

This one woke me up crying.
I walk into my house, to numerous cat poops on the floor, but they are all on fire. (Orange flames) But instead of putting out the fire, I walk past. I realize that there are also cat toys on fire too. There are two kittens, but it seems that everything they touch is becoming enflamed. One of the cats bats a toy my way and suddenly it’s on fire. One of the cats is playing under a coffee table and the toy/carpet is on fire so much it singes her fur! I grab the cat and cry because she’s singed but it doesn’t seem hurt then. I tell the other person the cats are setting things on fire, as they seem unaware. They snap back at me and then me: “it’s YOUR cat setting everything on fire!!!”
I quickly realize that somehow they set a couch on fire, mainly the arm of the couch. The foam inside is smoldering. I run to get a bucket, but the first one is broken. The next one is full of dirty water, so I try and flush it down the toilet but it goes everywhere and the bucket proceeds to break too. I run to the kitchen to get a large cup just to slow the smoldering. But the water pressure is low and it’s taking forever. I fill the cup as much as I can and run to extinguish the fire. I keep going back for more water, and eventually find that the foam is smoldering near the floor, so I focus my attention there. Soon the foam reaches the floor/carpet and starts to set it on fire too. Now I’m aiming at the floor, as the smoldering has turned to actual fire.

722,1602225336,"In the dream, I bought a house. I was in a different country, though I don’t know which ones. From the outside, it seemed tiny, dainty. Inside it was beautiful. Each floor was very small, painted lavender, and there were maybe about seven stories. Like my own personal tower. The rooms were full of furniture from the previous owner.

It started off amazing. Me, my mother (my mother lives in another country) and my best friend and her husband were cleaning the place out. I was keeping the furniture I did want, giving away others. One the rooms was a children’s room, with a small bed and a crib, both made of golden coloured metal. I gave the crib to my friend, as in my dream she was either newly pregnant or trying for a baby. As we were emptying that room, someone got a call that a local boy had been kicked out of his house by his awful father. We all knew of him. I told her to tell the kid he could stay here, in this room until he could go home or figure something out.

The boy never showed up in the dream, but somewhere around that conversation is when things started to go wrong.

My friend took a shower and saw someone looking at her from the drain. We checked every drain, and every drain in the house had someone looking through it. Like all you could see was the eyeball, looking up. The floorboards were suddenly rotten, they looked fine, but I’d step on them and they’d start to collapse down. I fell through the floor and into the basement of the house.

I contacted an insurance agent, and when I explained the issues he started to laugh, hysterically. Then that scene disappeared and suddenly I was someone else, a teen girl, trying desperately to pretend I went to a school I know I didn’t, trying to get this group of people to let me go somewhere with them. And not in the way of a teen just wanting to be included, they were doing something dangerous or bad and this girl, for some reason, needed to gain their trust, have them underestimate her, so she could find out what it was. It felt like her life depended on it. They ended up letting her tag along, but I woke up as soon as they started to walk away with her.

We have changed back diapers now to see if the diaper was the problem he also has a form of eczema so he has itchy skin at times . I told my husband it freaks me out cause my mom brain over thinks and since he wakes up with them in the morning I think what if a ghost or something. My husband reassures me there is no ghost .

I wake up and go to my son to get him out of his crib and he has scratches all over his tummy and back and I freak out send a video to my hubby .I go sit on the bed with him and I remember just being so scared in the room.

I open the door slightly and turn the key and then go to passenger side to get in when I noticed my fiancé turn off the car and say your not leaving .

My suspicion is that the dream characters are symbols of aspects of yourself and not about those people external to you in waking.

In that context I'd see your child as either an inner child aspect or maybe, and I think given the scene with the car as a symbol of the personal journey this is how I would lean, that he is a symbol of your personal development (the new version if you that has come out of you).

Your partner I think is representing your intellect (masculine as thinking vs feminine as feeling). So I would see this as saying your innrr child or developing self has been attacked but you don't understand how or why, and are intellectually refusing to contemplate it.

And in that refusal you are as a result also refusing to continue your journey (not driving).

I think the walker might be tied to that too, like you have the option to engage your analytucal mind and figure what is causing this issue and resolve the problem at its root, or you can stop your personal growth journey, put up with the symptoms (walker as a support dealing with being in a disabled state).

Topics: Dorm, pets, plane, family and packing ALL important belongings.

Hello I have been having a lot of dreams about college. I never went to a university or dorm of any sort.

Dream: packing up my dorm room trying to make sure I have all of my stuff because Once leave I can’t go back. In previous dreams I can never get everything packed to fit in my bags and take with me. last night I had family helping. my (divorced sense I was age 1) mom and dad helped. My dad drove out to wherever I was to put big things that wouldn’t fit on plane In his tiny car. My mom flew out to help. once we were ready to get on plane to head home my kids and cat showed up. I watched as they all buckled up and got ready for take off. But I was outside the window/door watching. I ended up missing the flight as it took off I was panicked. Not for me for my mom because she would be worried about me left alone in an unfamiliar place so late at night￼. I told her I’m ok I’ll catch the next one that was coming at 3 am. No biggie. ITS Ok! IM OK! is what I was yelling to her as the plane took off. The people in the airport looked worried for me till i said no I’m good I’m worried about her worrying. Then all the sudden I’m back in dorm room packing with my dad. He had helped take all the pictures of loved ones and special things down off the walls. We had almost everything packed up he was fitting my king size bed in his tiny car along with other large objects. I was just going to ride home with him I though why wait for the next plane. He said he was going to come back Monday and buy a pice of furniture I was leaving behind and even though I wanted the piece still I was like ok my loss his gain. He’s helping that’s what’s right I’ll find a new one. Then all the sudden he was gone and one of my kids was with me. we were packing anything else we could find before the next plane came. Odd thing here was we were packing purses and other to go bags into our bag to bring. Once I was on the plane my kid turned into one of my dogs and our other dog was outside the plane barking and now it was snowing. I looked out the window saw her and told the people not to take off. They opened the planes long back hatch like on a military plane to let her in and she came running up. I could feel the coldness coming from her. then i watched the snow melting once she sat next to me and I could feel the warmth of her snuggle. Then we were ready to take off but I told them I had to pee before the plane took off. The flight attendant was not happy bc I did the same thing last time before the plane almost took off. Turns out I had to pee for real so I got up and that was my dream.

Normally I can’t find my ticket or lose track of time is why I miss plane. I also never have helpers or get packed up as far as I did last night. The only thing that was holding me up from taking off this time was my bladder. The one time I did take off on the plane in the dream the windows were open and my pets were all stuffed in a crumbling cage bc they had to be in cages to be on the plane. This dream last night they were allowed on with leashes or without like
Mine that almost got left behind. I saw people get on with their dogs and they each had a dog leash on one red one blue. ￼

Thanks In advance for any input￼ and for sticking with me I know I have horrible spelling and grammar issues. 💟💡",2022-04-26 13:24:32,0,2,1408098999711754,1317912160,"Hello, the dorm could be about independence as college is a time in life when you move away from the support of family to live on your own and make your own decisions. It can also be about some learning from life experiences that you were reflecting on.You have support of your parents in the dream but they can be representing your rational (dad) and emotional (mom) sides. You seem to be quite capable on your own and more worried about taking care of others than worried about yourself. Plane trips can represent life aspirations or spiritual journeys. With your daughter being almost left behind, left out in the cold and then feeling her warmth and having to pee it would seem you may have some feelings or worries about her growing independence that you dislike. She could also be representing an aspect of you and indicating that deep down you really do have some tentative feelings about your situation yet you seem to regain your center easily with the knowledge your family is there for you and you for them.",2022-04-24 14:55:27,786,193

I believe that it may be time to stand up for yourself, stand in your power and speak your own truth. It might not be comfortable for you. When we are passive people and we try to be assertive, we feel like we are being aggressive. You can still be respectful of others and speak your truth. White owls in my experience mean some sort of change is coming that you were not expecting. I also view owls as messengers or bringers of intuitive insight, wisdom, a knowing of spiritual things.

I woke up after someone kissed me.

I dreamed I was a man with a female friend. She showed me her greenhouse solarium with beautiful healthy green plants and glass structure. Then led me outside through an open doorway. It was nighttime and the whole sky was filled with bright stars.

She cast a spell to bring out to make the inner self, the animus and homunculus, visible. She and I thought the spell was for herself and didn't work. But illuminated white ghostly figures appeared to me above, calmly pacing the green grass above us, with the stars in that background.

The ghostly figures were of a woman in white with a peaceful male lion.

I didn't understand and for a minute was agitated asking does anyone else see? The woman and a quiet little small dark terrier who was there barely seen like a friendly shadow they could not see the white figures above.

The woman became calm, content, and knowing as her spell had worked. It showed the inner self of me instead of herself

The images of the peaceful woman in white with the peaceful lion were similar to the Strength card in tarot

873,100026221010988,Hello new to this group!! But I think I’m going to love it! Why do I always dream of me having a baby? I’m not in a relationship.. I think I’m content with not having 1. But there’s always a newborn girl in my dreams and I’m pretty sure she’s mine. Also does anybody else always dream when they fall asleep? I woke up out my sleep 4 times and 4 times I either resumed the same dream or another one of my reoccurring dreams would start. I remember my dreams every night unless I’ve been drinking. Is that common? I will post more about them but if they are terrifying I literally tell myself this got to be a dream and wake myself up.,2022-04-26 03:48:24,0,2,1408596879661966,100009042510759,Having a baby is about starting a new something in life.

875,100064151898107,"First post! I posted an anonymous post, didn’t mean for it to be anonymous. It was just about how I started dreaming daily about 8 months ago which is wierd and freaky anyways:

Dream last night.

I was at my ex bfs house “we split in real life 1.5 years ago, I had to leave because of DV” so in my dream I was at his house but it was mine. I think I was in school had to study or something. My study buddies came over and they FLEW over 😂I thought it was so cool and this guy can’t remember a face, taught me how to fly. I started flying everywhere around the neighborhood!! I saw him do a flip, so I tried one but I immediately fell to the ground because I was to fat. He told me to fly better I had to lose some weight. I then proceeded to fly around. I flew to the neighbors and started swinging one arm on a tree and they where shocked I could fly. I told him I got the vaccine moderna shot and if he got it to he may also be able to fly 😂. Anyways now I’m back at home inside and there is a fight across the street and the guy has a gun. I had to hurry and get my mom, neice and someone else inside this car but it was like a clown car 😂😂. We all got in and I made them stay real quiet and I hurried it out the front door and down the street, it was so stressful. I woke after that.

In real time I woke at 5AM to a beeping in my ear like a car door for 5 seconds, that freaked me out and I started thinking I was hearing things so I didn’t go back to sleep till 6.

Then I went back to sleep for 2 hours, I just woke up BUt! For the first time in my dream something wierd happened. I was hanging with my brother, (prior to this part of my dream I was doing something but I can’t remember what I was doing.)we where In his van and I STARTED TELLING HIM ABOUT MY DREAM… from when before I woke at 5AM 😂 so crazy! Then I went on to someone breaking into my car and she stole my stuff, she was homeless and with other people but also lives in a sober house. She gave me back one pair of shoes and I finally got the other one from her after threatening her. I took the box home and they where diff shoes. I took them back to her and freaked out on her yelling. Her and her friends started looking for the shoe. It was taking forever; she got in my face and I told her to get out of my face or I would fight her. She didn’t so I punched her but it was a slow punch, I hit her face where her glasses where and didn’t think it hurt her but she said OWE and started crying. We where all of a sudden in her sober house and I was talking a bunch of smack to her and her friends calling them low life’s. Then I told them to go get a drug and alcohol assessment and I helped them with resources 😂 the girl that needed to find my shoe left to find my shoe in a golf cart full of her stuff. So I asked her roommate where her other stuff was and she showed me bexause I was going to take some of her stuff as collateral until she got me my shoe. But it was all baby stuff and I didn’t wanna take her baby stuff. All of a sudden I was on the roof my mom was there and someone else idk who and I thought I was to fat for the roof and I was going to break it. Then all of a sudden it was not my real mom but it was my street mom and she was nice and helped me and showed me where the girls food was. I messed up her cupboards and took some of her food. (I have clients in real life for my job) one of my clients I haven’t heard from was in my dream and I told her you neeed to call me you are not in compliance and she shut the door on me. I was irritated but I left and remember thinking in my dream about daily stuff it’s wierd. Anyways I walk outside and it’s like a beautiful Christmas wonderland and these 2 men said hello to me really nice but I felt like they where only nice bexause they wanted me to buy things from the venders at the park… it was snowing… then I woke up.

Sorry if that was a lot. I left a lot out.",2022-04-24 17:21:21,0,1,1408822666306054,780839497,"hmm the left out stuff could be significant.

What I'm picking up is a lesson you need to learn from your past relationship (your ex's school that is your school) and I suspect it relates to how you interacr with others (the second dream with talking smack to people in some way being tied to weight issues? Also tied to vaccines too? And trying to sell something for non-altruistic purposes...?",2022-05-01 14:56:29,919,80

I then asked her why she was upset she said because her children were not doing very well. I also notice a girl I work with on this bed.

M mum passed very suddenly in 2012 it was really hard not being able to say goodbye and now at least once a month she is in my dream but I'm on my way to her and I never get to her before I wake up it's like my mind is not letting me see her.

The dream seems to be about your psyche missing that opportunity to say goodbye before she passed yet really wanting what is not possible. I wonder if you might write her a letter with all you would have said had you had the opportunity and speak the words aloud to your favorite picture of her if you think it would give you some peace? Sometimes engaging in ritual or ceremony can help us through these difficult times of our lives. Wishing you all the best.♥️,2022-04-24 14:56:45,73,97

I had this dream in the night and remember the end clearly…

I was parking my car quickly as I was just dropping into a garage to ask something.

So reversing in but found myself not in a bay because somehow the lines were reflections from something , rather than drawn lines, which my car obscured so I pulled back out and reversed back into what was now a space.

A man was stood washing cars next to where I was as this was happening…

I had to also at the same time do a school drop off and met a family where the mum was carted around on a stretcher which was more like a ping pong table , but with felt fabric, in size and quite low to the ground.
She was cut in half by her hips. Sort of squashed rather than a clean cut.
There was no blood just brown marks and some missing body parts were spread about randomly on the stretcher.
She was naked but she looked like a mannequin.
Her husband and children were with her.

In waking life I am torn and my way forward is uncertain. I am trying to change my career path and work pattern and I worry about the future a little bit.

The school drops offs end this summer which is why I am able to do these changes in real life.

I'm not sure if this is the right group to ask but I will try anyway...

Years and years ago, when I was born a cousin in my family who was 3 at the time turned to her mom and told her out of the blue that I had just been born (exact day), I was a girl and she told her my name. (My name or gender wasn't known to anyone before my birth). Her mom told her that isn't true and I wasn't due yet (I was 4 weeks early).
My auntie later that day recieved a call from my dad who let her know i had been born that day and told them the gender and name (which my cousin had got correct). For years we have joked saying we have a psychic connection.

Last night, I had a dream that she came to my house and told me she was expecting a baby. I messaged her today telling her about my dream. I had the shock of my life today when she called me straight away and told me she is pregnant but hasn't let anyone know yet because she is only 8 weeks. She wasn't trying to conceive so I don't even know how this has come about in my mind whilst I was asleep.

Does anyone know of any information about this sort of stuff?

986,221140256522169,"I had a dream last night where I found myself with my family, with a sister that I don't know. Somehow accidently I hurt my sister and my father started applying bandages on her. Then I saw a rainstorm and just after that, a flood making water level as high, enough to cover up ground and 1st floor level. I saw a red car going to right if my house and starts struggling to get out the water (off course water already covered ground and 1st floor, no way to get our of water) and slowly starting submerging. However, the driver was able to open the car door and try to jump on one of the roof of the house whose tip was still not fully submerged, and he was successfull (car colour was red). As water level was rising and me and my family was still on 1st floor, I rushed in the rooms and try calling my father to come and go to upper level (my house has total ground, 1st, 2nd and 3rd level as a roof (accessible)) and I started collecting warm clothes, blanket with me to take to another level. But when I came out of the room, I saw water level gone down a bit (like 40%) and the current 1st level floor was safe and now there was no need to go to next level. Then, I saw the family and the guy (who successfully took out and jumped on the tip of other's house roof, mentioned earlier) in the balcony of same other's house.

993,100078462727492,"Okay so, has anyone had a dream of a horse that looks like this?

I believe the breed could be (Appaloosa or knabstrupper cross paint)

Anyway the horse kind of looked like this but had paint markings on him/her too.

When I saw this horse in my dream I was so mesmerised by their beauty.

Funnily enough, I went to look at a horse today and I’m going to be adopting her from a rescue (she’s not the same colour, she’s flea bitten grey).

I’m so intrigued to know what this dream means. I hope somebody can decipher it for me please?",2022-04-25 16:32:00,2,5,1407456666442654,554421340,"Nękø Nightfall this looks to me like Pippi Longstocking's horse, Old Man.

While she would ride the horse, she would also carry him, because she was extraordinarily
strong.

If you know this story, I wonder if it has any relevance as a symbol for your dream

Adopting a horse for your rescue for example, might be about how you are rediscovering your childlike sense of wonder and adventure and extraordinary strength, by ""carrying"" this horse - by taking care of an animal, that traditionally, is considered to be of service to humans for farming or carrying humans. Instead, you will be taking care of and tending this horse.

If the horse is ""retired"" then the name of Pippis horse ""old man"" might be relevant

Horse - (and Pippi!) - keyword I think of is strength.

Oh I just noticed paint markings were on your dream horse - yes, in Pippi, the spots were painted on lol I do seem to recall that...

To have spots painted on, in this rescue horse scenario might be that the ""negative marks against this horse"" are superficial and artificial. ""Painted on"" as in falsified, the ""black marks"" against adopting this animal are not truly valid.

Possibly also there is a saying of being ""unable to change one's spots (or stripes)"" meaning that we cannot change who we are, who we appear to be, cannot change our nature.

This horse, however, it seems like it CAN change it's spots lol it can change its nature

Spots can also be a pun, if for example when you adopt the animal you will change its location. It might be the feeling that if you adopt it and change it's location, the negative marks on it's character are going to change

Horse... strength, speed, power... being burdened or saddled with responsibility or work, can also be about freedom if unsaddled, if it has blinkers on it could be about blindspot you have.

A bridle can be a pun for a wedding, and commitment

Wild horse can be a free spirit",2022-04-24 14:58:34,123,405

Cats can also represent female sexuality, introversion or intuition among other things. The fact they are feral in the dream suggests you were judging yourself for not attending to them and letting your more animalistic urges run free.

If you are also the driver, as some dream interpretations

Otherwise, it is someone in your life that you are offering counterpoint to - their intense drive, and your going with the flow, this is having success against all odds.

I think of also the idea of a ""steep incline""

Inclination - can mean a desire or character habit. Is there something that you are VERY much not normally inclined to do (you are only 5% inclined to do this) and yet you are having success because of your intense drive to do it, paired with your going with the flow, possibly allowing others to take the main lead?

I was there for vacations, in my old house (now sold in real life because the area it was in became too polluted). But my house was also my high-school (which were nowhere near in real life). And I was hiding in my mother's room because I was depressed and wanted nothing to do with school. But I was still a teenager and my partners were still at school. Except my best friend Johnpi, who joined me in my mother's room to investigate... a murder. He needed a calm place to do that, so he skipped school. And he appreciated my help. He asked our classroom's nerd (who wasn't actually the classroom nerd in real-life) to give us copy in the math homework and she agreed. The whole classroom was very supportive of our endeavour, unlike in real-life. To skip gym class, the guys pretended to fall and get hurt to keep the teacher busy so she would not notice our absense. Oh, and this teacher was both the math and the gym teacher, in real life she was a literature teacher I had in university.

Fast-forwards, my mother complained I didn't go out enough, and that I should. I was depressed and didn't want to go anywhere, but said I would go out if my other best friend Angel agreed to meet with me. So I called him, told him I was in town, and asked if he would like to meet. He very excitingly accepted. ""Great! Should I bring something?"" I asked, excited too now, wondering if I should bring my Switch so we could play Pokemon.

A little backstory. I take care of my little brother, but we have been having a lot of behavioral issues with him at home and school, he also does not respect me or my husband.

Last night I had a dream, and we were at the house and decided we needed to go to the store for a couple things, I caught my brother leaving the door unlocked so I told him and my mom to go ahead of me and I locked everything behind me. We go to the store get what we need and head outside, my mother and I saw something we wanted and told my brother to go get in the car. We came out 2 minutes after him and I put the stuff in the car look in the back seat and the door is open but he is gone. I begin to freak out and we start to drive around while trying to call the cops when he comes out of no where all beat up. We begin to drive him to the hospital when he tells me it’s cause the house was locked and the robbers couldn’t get in.

He was jogging on the highway and I heard him calling someone name in the projects across the highway. Him and his wife got married in the backyard.

Maybe your not the same person you were when you married, and your beginning to recognise that.

Getting married twice suggests there is some new stage of commitment to each other. The marriage taking place in the backyard i feel means its of low importance or kept private somehow.

Jogging on the highway towards the projects, maybe you feel your husband has other projects that take him away from the marriage somehow, work or hobbies that he is involved with.

I wonder if you feel your husband feels differently about you.

In both one or two grey wolves are guiding me to information, I know it's information.
One dream there are two large grey wolves, walking beside me, looking up at me smiling while I rest my hands behind each of their necks. They bring me to my ancestors who share the same eyes as me, bright shining pinkish eyes. There are many all over the hills waiting for me and looking up at the night sky full of stars. But I wake up not understanding any of that.
Then this weekend I dreamt a grey wolf led me to a clearing in the woods at night to show me something in the night sky. I can't remember what exactly he was showing me but in my dream I lift up my arm to point at the sky as if to ask, ""You want me to see this?"" but when I turn my head to look where I'm pointing I see my arm but it has the sillouette of a grizzly bears arm and hand, fingers, nails. As I moved my hand around it moves with me, now I see that the bear sillouette is spirit and that it is a part of me.

I felt like that when my dad passed so I can imagine that feeling would be even stronger with a spouse. Maybe your dreams are about your inner conflict where you are torn between grieving him and wanting to stop grieving but feeling like you are supposed to grieve forever. Also, if you believe that loved ones can visit you in your dreams from the other side, it could be taken as a message from him that he wants you to move on and be happy without him. If you had passed instead of him, would you want him to be miserable and miss you for the rest of his life or would you be screaming at him from the other side to find happiness and live for the both of you? Just a thought. The other woman he left you for in your dream could just symbolize him leaving you in this world to be in the next. Even though it wasn't his choice to leave you in reality, that doesn't mean you don't hold anger inside at losing him, whether that anger is at him, or God, or the universe, pain often presents itself in the form of anger.

You say you had a stable relationship and that he was sick during the last year when you gave all of yourself to him. This experience may hold some shadows of self blame, a feeling of not having done enough as is common for many people who take care of their spouses or other relations through a terminal illness. The caretakers question themselves and engage in self-criticism and self judgment..

The age 24 may be implying a few things. It could be that his health started declining 4 years before he passed, it could be implying a significant experience you had at the age of 24.

You have a sense of losing precious time together, there may be a fear of loneliness. Him leaving you behind is being perceived by some part of your Heart as his betrayal, but you're assuming you share the ""blame"" even as a victim of his betrayal, even in spite of all you did to help.

I see these as the dreams of a Heart on the mend. Life, Death, we don't perceive much beyond the limits of our 5 senses, it doesn't mean nothing exists beyond Life and Death.

He will reach through with increasing clarity as you continue moving upwards, on this spiral of individual growth across time we Humans have the privilege of experiencing as Life on Earth.

You sound like an extremely devoted, loyal, committed, and sincere partner, someone who stands with her companion and doesn't let go when they're drowning.

Some part of our Heart hopes and prays that our input would yield results that would at least partly be based on our deepest desires (you'd have wanted the both of you to stay together forever).

You did everything you could, perhaps some part of you wonders if he did all he could.

Allow yourself to heal. Try to recall your best and healthiest times together.

I was watching from a window in a tall building, as I tried to look closer I realized I had walked onto a ledge outside the glass. I quickly returned inside.
The scene switched to a different room. I found two snakes on the floor. One was a boa, the other a python. Both looked in very poor health, one badly burned and the other with skin peeling off. I felt badly for them and wasn’t sure what to do.

Just imagine looking at a doll house where you could see every floor and every room. That’s the way the building looked. But there was a long black screen draping the front of the building. The police were there, trying to talk the couple out of jumping. They were unsuccessful. The woman pushed the screen and jumped, and the man jumped right after her.

So these people could symbolize aspects of yourself that are changing. There might be a part of yourself that your changing or putting an end to. The police could symbolize the part of you that is trying to stop it from happening and keep those aspects alive. The dream is showing that this part of you was unsuccessful. It's possible that the two people are symbolic of someone else you know who is changing out putting and end to an old aspect of themselves. And the police - the side of yourself that's trying to stop it. A house often represents the self. Your self is under construction - being worked on. And you can see into every part of the self because it's missing a wall. So you're perhaps being transparent? But yet there is this black screen covering the face of the building.

When I came out I was on a bicycle and a Ghostbuster. My first job was recruit people and bust a cave witch, her husband who is a Djinn and their children.",2022-04-24 14:55:32,0,1,1405471399974514,560345596,"Hi, I have a few suggestions. My thoughts are thaf the dream is about the way you are progressing with your life. You know you need to clean things up.

Perhaps you have some conserns that you are headed towards a risky or volatile future in some way. And this is a future to which you know you dont belong.

The engine I feel is about your inner self and your own personal source of power. What is if that makes ""your motor run""? What is if that gets you going in life, that gives you drive and motivation? Have lost your motivation for life? Do you need a tune up, because your dream suggests you need to clean this up too! Water can of course represent emotions and healing. Washing is a symbol of cleasing. The attendant is a part of you, the part that needs to pay attention and ""attend"" to these inner parts so you move forward with power.

When you ""clean up"" this attendant part knows you will be fine.

The bike suggests that you need to become more indipendant and to focus on your own very personal journey in life. There maybe some ghosts from yoyr past that also need busting in order for you to do this.

I feel the job you must do is to get some help and support. Who can you recruit or employ, to help you bust these ghosts? Perhaps a therapist or councellor?

The cave is an ancient symbol for the inner dark caverns of our own self. The place where our shadow self hides. All the parts that we reject and repress, all the parts of our own selves that cause us trouble. Parts that have been hurt, insecurities, shame, anger etc. The witch and her husband suggest a sense of ""evil"" or badness you perhaps feel inhabits your own darkness. There is a clear family unit here too so there could be some links to you'd own family or upbringing.

In my opinion this is a powerful dream that calls you to do some personal work and healing. I wish you courage in your efforts.",2022-04-24 15:02:20,109,403

You say you spoke only to your father as he arrived at the scene when you saw the mess. You spoke about cleaning up the place. This to me indicates that you are using your power of discernment and action to engage in shadow-work. Shadow-work is about facing our shadows and cleaning up our psychological anchorages. It requires focus, courage, will power, determination, and discernment. These are all aspects of the Masculine side of the energy spectrum. The Father indicated that you'd be falling back on your learned Masculine ways to engage in this work. The Feminine side is about openness, acceptance, tolerance, patience etc. That remained in the background in your dream along with the young Masculine. You're engaging a specific section of your mind to do this inner work.

The pigeons may symbolize your natural self, the unconditioned self trying to shine through your conditioned self. Excrement of any form in dreams is usually symbolic of creativity so your dream would imply you have immense potential waiting to be unleashed, which without active channeling has led to a scattered mess within. Perhaps the element of shyness or conditioning of ""right and wrong"" is playing a part in you stifling some aspects of yourself.

You remove the ""curtains"" to clean them. That's symbolic of voluntarily uncovering the deeper wounds, the deeper self, and also symbolic of being open to Light (to enlightenment, to self-awareness)
by willingly uncovering the access to your own Self.

As there was more Light, you did see more of what you needed to ""clean"". This naturally happens when we go down this path of actively engaging in our spiritual ascension through shadow-work. More and more comes to light that needs to be transmuted.

In each moment in life, we deal with the issue at hand to the best of our knowledge, capacity, and intentions at that given point. This may lead to discovering things that would leave us feeling demotivated, but our Masculine energies of persistence and courage always come in handy.

The dream was interrupted, but I believe it has conveyed to you the message it carried. You're subconsciously growing into a new person because the global environment has been changing drastically, yet on some levels imperceptibly. The same dynamic is being reflected in all individuals based on our unique circumstances.

Depending on how your life may have been changing (I didn't see an indication of turbulence, just natural smooth ascension and growth), the dream indicates that you're actively finding ways to express your true self in spite of how things may appear initially.

I always suggest earthing and grounding, and I also suggest visualization meditation to feed especially the Heart Chakra with the intention that the Heart will strengthen the other six. I also recommend aiming for at least 3 litres of water a day. It really helps with the process somehow.",2022-04-24 15:03:04,234,575

EDIT: I decided to add a quick summary of *most* of the dream. This isn’t the full thing obviously, just a brief explanation because there are honestly too many things going on and too many strong emotions to cover.

In said dream I was part of some unit made up of child soldiers (except I wasn’t child, the others were) called the “F.S.W unit” or something like that, where all the kids line up and start filing in to this platform in the middle of a huge arena where there’s crowds all around watching, and once they get to the platform it’s like Russian roulette where there’s a 50/50 chance that a few will end up dying.
The way they end up dying is that Chucky (you know, the creepy doll) runs around underneath the platform with his hand out, grabbing the kid’s hands, and if the kid squeezes his hand back then he sentences them to death by chasing after them with a huge knife.
I eventually caught onto this, so I stopped squeezing his little hand whenever he’d put it out and he was like “fucksakes, this bitch is gonna be a tricky one” or something (sorry for the language).
Then I had a military uniform on and gear and had to crawl/run really fast throughout a series of tunnels that my bedroom was connected to in order to get away.
Then my boyfriend was there, but can’t really remember what he was doing. I was sitting in fetus position up against a wall with all my stuff on and I just remember him bending down in front of me and saying something, but I had PTSD and was confused.
Then when Chucky captured me, I sprouted wings and transformed into some purple bird god named “Raksha” and was able to get away and they were like “It’s the second coming of Raksha!

support (Chucky's hand) but really isn't.

It can mean a symbol of loving oneself, embracing a part of oneself, psychological integration.

A celebrity might have specific symbolizing. For example dreaming of having sex with Madonna might symbolize embracing the duality of your innocence + sexuality

I was captured by 2 men & there were a few other people with me but the main guy killed them right away, so I was the only one left. I begged him not hurt me, to not kill me. He laughed and said he wouldn't. He then put the gun to my head and I begged him once again not to kill me. He said he wouldn't and then he pulled the trigger but nothing came out (it wasn't a revolver). Then he pulled the trigger a second time and nothing came out and he was annoyed. The third time he pulled the trigger a bullet came out and went right into the right side of my head. In that moment I could literally feel myself from dying. There was no pain, my body turned numb/limp/tingly, I saw my vision changing, it was like I was moving into a different dimension or a different world. It was bright and welcoming but not plain nothingness. It was so calming, peaceful moving though my vision was split.

First night of dreaming: I was running away from a day time rain, the skies were a beautiful bright blue. It was coming after me, I didn’t want it to touch me. I was jumping from roof top to rooftop in a place that resembled the favela of Brazil. Suddenly there’s a helicopter and someone who I can’t see their face reaches their hand out to me and pulls me inside before the rain could touch me. I’m dry and saved. I wake up.

Second night of dreaming: I’m now wet, the rain has touched me. I’m in a forest somewhere. There’s a women who feels like a spirit. I only see her from the back, I can’t tell her age wether she’s young or old, maybe she had white braided hair and wearing native clothes. she’s running somewhere and I feel like I must follow her, so I do. She leads me to shelter. I wake up.

Third night of dreaming: I’m alone and dry. I’m on a beach somewhere, and in the distance of the horizon is the most magical scene I’ve ever seen. There’s a massive tsunami wave touching the skies like it was reaching out for heaven, wide as the eye can see everywhere I look from left to right.

I ll preface the dream that everything in the dream is you/aspect of you and so finding this ornate desk in a yard sale symbolism is a dream's way of saying you need to find (and appreciate) your own beauty and by going further inside /opening certain part of you/checking the inside, you are to discover your value. Yard sale would indicate some sentiment around old stuff/no longer serving/but also letting go as people are usually doing it when decluttering/
moving on
There is a feeling of guilt that has surfaced in the dream but try to work with and identify the presence of this feeling in your body away from the actual imagery (which the dream is just using to open your eyes to this guilt).
Sometimes giving yourself the permission to find your beauty and value (again) will come with a hinged guilt attached ('who do you think you are' type of voice) and this guilt can be cultural and societal /passed down the family line..not to absolve from our own, but do take a wider view when looking at this.

I’m freaking out because I’m thinking how much strength did they have to have to pull this little red headed girl through and drain, and how messed up her body was look now!

(I want to add some better description of how close we live , imagine a square and it’s three houses but my house has two acres so it would take up the room for the forth house to have our houses right across the street from each other’s) so my dad and frank look at each other and say that’s probably him and after they say that the older guy right across the street with his truck broken into step out his door and screams. “HES HEADED YALLS WAY” so the person who broke in was a mid sized,black male. But I remembered seeing a white hand through the drain. So sense we live so close I tried to run to my house for safety and it was too late, my dad pull out his Glock the guy pulled out his gun and two shots were fired and I just shut my eye and I seen white, and it was like as if I felt the bullets as well but I just kept walking towards my house. I didn’t even look to see who had died I just went back to my room crying to my mom and my boyfriend and as I’m on the floor like hysterically crying I stand up and through the window I see the black male wrapped up (dead) and being put into like a police van. I distinctly remember after I seen his dead body in my head I went “I just seen a dead body”. I went into more of a shock and then more of a hysterical cry, and I remember my mom trying to get my grandma to come out and to calm me down, she gets to my house I head outside, and the last part before I woke I just remember sinking into her arms while falling on the prettiest, greenest grass I’ve ever seen.",2022-04-22 23:39:59,0,1,1404029820118672,780839497,"This is a pretty complex dream, Im nit sure I have any solid ideas; but it does seem to relate to being influenced by outside forces (those taking people through the drain) snd being intruded upon, feeling threatened and conflict.

Maybe this dream was a gift to you (imo all dreams are...) so that you could experience the FEELING of having extra money in your bank account. If you're interested in manifesting, one of the key components to manifesting your desires is the feeling/
emotion you're vibrating out into the world. So if you felt really good in the dream, well now you can manifest this extra money (or any type of abundance) in your waking life by getting back into this emotional state. Just some food for thought... 🙂",2022-04-24 15:06:36,70,114

I was standing Infront of my bathroom mirror with purple and blue hair. I’ve had these colours in my hair before but not currently. I remember preferring these colours for some reason but in waking life i prefer the pink.

I know it’s not very detailed but I’m just rather intrigued to see what it means.

Also, I wasn’t gonna mention this second dream. But, there was a girl I used to go to primary school with and once in a blue moon I have dreams about her. I don’t think about her in waking life and I haven’t spoken to her for several years. I just think it’s odd. If you want the details of the dream from last night I was in a shopping isle with her and she was just sitting on the ground. I can’t remember the rest so it’s nothing to go off really.

How you view her and whether thats a topical issue at the time of the dream is a good starting point.

As for the hair, thats not easy really. Since it comes from the head it can relate to thought, but could also be about how you present/
organise yourself outwardly, lots of ways to look at hair.

Blue and purple, its hard not to look at chakras, especially licated around the head so might be about communication (blue) or intuition (purple); but again other associations you could delve into.",2022-04-24 15:06:53,242,130

I dreamt that I was in a seaside town somewhere. I was actually going to see someone. Someone who was popular on tv and was able to keep the magic of childhood alive for many people (still doing it today). I stopped outside a house which was next to a beach. It wasn’t a flashy beach house but it had a homey cosy look and feel to it. This man came out, and I asked for the person in question I was looking for, and I was told I was at the right place and to go in. There I met the person I was looking for. And he was actually really nice and friendly and chatty. He showed me around the house and he took me to one room, and I saw the most amazing collection of memorabilia of this tv childhood. And that w was when I woke up.

I want to add that I have met this person a couple of times in real life, and he is a great person and very friendly.

What I mean is you think logic and avoid thinking emotionally.

The train that isn’t coming is kinda of the expression “missing the train” but it isn’t quite it.
You “don’t see a train”.
You are waiting at flashing light so there is a sense of emergency/
danger ahead.
You do a u-turn.

It can be seen as “forget Plan A, let’s take plan B”.
(Change of directory instead of waiting… acting upon).

Going upstairs is seen as “improving your life”.
You dad is ahead of you.
Maybe you need guidance a little bit.

Doctors appointment is to “fix something with you.”

Fixing something maybe you aren’t feeling your top self and you aren’t sure how to fix it.

People being old could be wisdom or vulnerability.
As you reach a state where you feel you need more wisdom or you feel dependant/
vulnerable.

2:08 can be “infinite duality.”

Announcing of your name is “you want it to be your turn”.

1522,100002951635029,"Hei. I have had so many sad dreams for about a year. Crying and screaming in my sleep, + it freaks my bf out.
My dad committed suicide 12 years ago, I was 11 at the time. I had a tough time dealing with it for many years, but I’ve been working on letting go and move on for about 3 years.
The dreams are very different, but it’s always the same pattern: my dad comes back for a day, week, month, and he totally ignores me. I try to talk to him but he just pushed me away and talk to everyone else. Then when it’s time for him to go back to “heaven” (I’m not a religious person), he tells me he loves me and misses me, and that I have to move on. And then I scream and cry and wake up crying.
Last night I dreamt that he was back, I was a kid again, and all my family was together looking for a house and trying to start “a new life”, everything was the way it was before he died. All my family, brother, mom, dad, grandpa and grandpa, aunts etc was sitting around a table, eating dinner. Then I “woke up”, and I was all alone by the table. So I woke up from a dream, in my dream. And I started crying and looking for my family, and I said over and over “it’s too much, I can’t take this anymore”, and then I woke up crying.
It feels like the more I’m working on moving on from my past, my dreams about family and dad gets worse. I don’t know what to do or what it means.

1524,100002951635029,"Hei. I have had so many sad dreams for about a year. Crying and screaming in my sleep, + it freaks my bf out.
My dad committed suicide 12 years ago, I was 11 at the time. I had a tough time dealing with it for many years, but I’ve been working on letting go and move on for about 3 years.
The dreams are very different, but it’s always the same pattern: my dad comes back for a day, week, month, and he totally ignores me. I try to talk to him but he just pushed me away and talk to everyone else. Then when it’s time for him to go back to “heaven” (I’m not a religious person), he tells me he loves me and misses me, and that I have to move on. And then I scream and cry and wake up crying.

I think you are dreaming of your dad more and more because while the feeling of loss was raw and unprocessed, all you felt was the grief of his loss, and the palpable absence of this person.

You felt ""he is gone! He is not here!"" And the pain of that was first and foremost.

Now that you are processing the grief, you are moving back to the feeling of his presence, and the joy and comfort that you felt being together with him, the love he had for you.

You always had the joy, love and comfort there too, underneath the pain of loss, but couldn't access it.

Now you can open and access this joy again, because the grief is not making you turn away from the happiness that is there.

Of course this is a scary process - opening to feeling comfort, joy, love, security, happiness, this is a reminder of how that good feeling is something that can be taken away. Which is frightening. And causes inner conflict ""maybe I shouldn't feel the joy, because then it will hurt more if I lose that feeling""

The dream is telling you, ""you never lost that feeling, it has always been there and it always will be there. The joy is bigger than the grief. The pain turned you away from the joy, the joy never left""

It is saying that your father, in this way, and also in how you are very much like him in many good ways, your father has never left you.

Instead of feeling his absence, you are feeling his presence, as you open up to the positive attachment you felt with him, and as you open up to the side of yourself that is very much like your father.

In the dreams, the contrast of being alone and being with family is a reminder that you are never truly alone when you have loved and been loved. For all those you connect with in life, you live in their hearts, as they live in yours. In this way, there is a life beyond death, time, and place. Karoline Stølhaug good luck to you in healing, trust the work you are doing 💙",2022-04-17 15:07:47,364,444

1531,100008611569028,"Hi all, I had a bit of an odd dream that I woke up from about an hour or so ago.

I can't remember specifically how it started, but there was a male individual that was ousted from my family for something he didn't do. Rather than siding with my family on this one I believed in him as I knew he could never have done what he was being accused of.

At some point, things escalated where my family was planning to chase him away, so the both of us left.

We ended up splitting when we left and I somehow ended up in my dad's apartment. No one was present but his wife, and there was a Golden Retriever there. He was filthy, and as I tried to hose him down I could see all the dirt and grime coming off of him. I thought there was no way I could let him stay there.

Well, I happened to look around and also saw there was a baby, and the baby needed it's diaper changed. That's when my dads wife came in and I became angry, telling her I was going to take the baby as it was obvious she was unfit to take care of her. She was pretty calm during the whole interaction but tried to take her baby back, but eventually relented and went back to her room while I changed the baby.

By the end of it all, I realized that I was just overreacting. At least, in terms of the baby, as it wasn't like she had been crying and put two and two together and figured the baby had probably just made a mess and it wasn't his wife's fault. However, there was definitely no excusing the neglected dog.

I went into her room with the baby and apologized, telling her I knew she was a good mom and that I was sorry for attempting to take her baby, that I knew she would never forgive me if I had taken her.

His wife told me it was alright, that the reason why she didn't fight so hard is because she knew I would make the right decision. She then told me, for whatever reason, that if I wanted from now on I could come and fold her laundry and she's pay me $1.75 every time I did her laundry. I told her no thanks and was planning to leave with the dog, but then I woke up.

I woke up feeling very sad and guilty. I don't normally remember dreams, but this one stuck with me and I couldn't really find anything online about what it could mean.",2022-04-20 09:47:35,1,1,1401800630341591,100009042510759,This is about you evolving and taking a stand for yourself in life. Standing up for the male individual was you speaking up for yourself. Taking a stand in life. You speak your peace about the baby but realize that you may have pushed it a bit too much. It's because you are learning about loyalty and how it fits or works in your life. That is why you are cleaning the dog off. This represents your loyalty because dogs are very loyal. You are learning the value of being loyal and becoming loyal to the truth. That is what I see with this dream.,2022-04-17 15:07:54,501,115

As with this dream, myself, my husband and some of my his family members were in a room that we had to clear out but there was a feeling that everything in the room was new to me, the first time I saw it. Like the furniture and the drawers were full of jewellery and ornaments which felt like they were the previous owner's and there were antique dressers and cupboards etc. All full of treasures I felt I wanted to keep as I was discovering them for the first time and I did not want to clear any of them out! Many of the dreams about houses are of the similar frequency in details.....always the house is old, there are many rooms and I keep looking for more, small or big and I sometimes find new items. Sometimes the dream is black and white but this mornings dream was in colour as the jewellery was colourful. Especially a ring I found, as I held it I dropped it and had to bend down to look for it. I found it and specifically it was a round band, half in baguette cut emeralds. Can anyone explain why the dream recurs? 1) Why the house is always old? 2) Why am I always looking for more rooms? 3) Why do I sometimes find treasures and not other times? 4) What am I constantly searching for!? Many thanks in advance :-)",2022-04-19 15:57:22,0,1,1401225640399090,780839497,"My answers to your questions:

1) the house represents you, you might be like an ""old soul"" or maybe linking to what was there before you were even born ie traits you are born with

2) the search for new rooms I tie to self discovery, lessons in knowing thyself

3) the treasures I'd link to what you treasure, soul wealth rather than material wealth so not how you make a buck but what you value which is in my opinion worth a whole heap more

4) I think you are constantly searching for you, self understanding and perhaps spiritual truth",2022-04-17 15:09:10,326,113
1591,100000367915780,"I keep having these dreams about being in danger with 2 other people, whether its being chased by wild animals or some type of predator in a purge like situation.

Im never scared and I always manage to effectively gather everything and escape unscathed without any extra drama or loss of bearings.

Reoccuring typically means something crucial i must pay attention to/ focus on.",2022-04-19 14:49:45,0,1,1401226433732344,780839497,hmm although you arent afraid you still avoid your fear and don't confront the problems in life maybe?,2022-04-17 15:09:13,68,20
1592,100000351851011,Thank you for accepting my request this is going to be a long post. Years ago after I split up with my son's father I started seeing a man named Earl. We had a really good time together. I really liked him. He had problems though and he drank way too much. He would get sloppy drunk almost every day. So I had to break it off with him. I didn't want to but I couldn't help him and at the time I had a 3 year old to care for that didn't need to be around a falling down drunk. It broke his heart when I ended things. He blew my phone up for over a week begging me for another chance. I stood my ground and kept telling him no. One evening my son and I were at a friend's house when he showed up crying drunk still begging me. I was annoyed so I grabbed my son and we went home and went to bed. That night I dreamt that his identical brother died. The dream was so vivid. I remember being really worried about Earl. I was looking everywhere for him to see if he was okay. I finally found him and he was just standing there smiling at me. I ran up to him and told him I was sorry about the loss of his brother and he didn't say a word he just kept smiling. I went to hug him and it was one of those really long hugs that you don't want to end. Then I woke up. About 10 mins after I woke his sister called me to inform me that he had passed away in the night. He overdosed. Am I crazy for thinking that really wasn't a dream? I believe his soul was telling me goodbye. Does anyone have any thoughts or opinions on this occurrence? Please and thank you.,2022-04-17 02:43:01,,5,1399004917287829,100010653487683,"Long reply, but.., On the one hand it would makes sense that you would dream about him after such an emotional experience happening in your real life. It makes sense that you would want to go to him and hug him, as you had to fight your own desires to leave in the first place. His smile could simply be relief that you had sought him out after trying so hard to win you back.

On the other hand, I’ve met people with similar dreams, for lack of better term, that are really uncanny and hard to dismiss. I’ve had some myself... So while I can’t say it is, I wouldn’t tell you that it’s not, and you certainly aren’t crazy for considering all options.",2022-04-17 15:09:16,355,152

A long endless hug is something that could not be achieved in the physical world because of the circumstance, but it found it’s way...Well done for doing what you had to do I think when all is said and done he agreed that it was for the best ❤️ was it a dream?

1597,1403261066,Does anyone know why we dream of a certain song? I was asleep and heard the song The Promise by When in Rome. 1988 😱 long time ago. It was one of my favorites back then. I just went to the store yesterday and don't recall hearing it. We don't play music at work and I played my own CD in the car.

1601,1084347601,"Hello, so this is so weird bc I had said to a friend out loud the other day how I never remember my dreams anymore and now 3 nights in a row I have had dreams! First I posted , the second by the time I woke up I couldn’t remember and the 3rd. I found $10,000 in the woods. But kept it hidden bc I was afraid the rightful owner would tell me I couldn’t keep it…….there was also a gun with the money 😂",2022-04-19 13:35:45,0,1,1401165577071763,100009042510759,The money represents some gain or wealth that you don't feel that you deserve. The gun makes it feel illegal. I feel this dream is saying you deserve this. You are worthy. I see the money representing something else that you find.
