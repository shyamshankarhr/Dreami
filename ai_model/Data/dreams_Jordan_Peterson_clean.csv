Jung would say the turtle is a common symbol of the Self, a turtle on it's back or about to fall might represent a less than ideal state of the Self, one in need of/lacking help. He has also described the turtle as representing the transcendent function, that which unites the opposites. Jung has also said reptile-like scales - and the dragon - are associated with the sympathetic nervous system. Incidentally, the sympathetic nervous system is what constricts blood vessels, allowing them to move through smaller spaces under pressure, as you were in this dream. I wonder whether your blood taking on a watery quality is somehow also related. You said you woke up cold. vasoconstriction of the blood vessels is what keeps you warm when cold. Ordinarily, blood is associated with emotion, in Jungian interpretations. To me, this dream seems like it might be about integration of the personal Shadow, in order to aid the development of the Self, but given your point about watery blood, crawling along constricted routes, and waking up cold, I wonder whether this dream is simply a response to your physical state at the time of the dream.",28-01-2022 11:20,405,255,,I woke up cold and anxious

There is a very classic interpretation by Jung (one of his own dreams if I remember correctly) where he interpreted a house in a dream as an image if the mind. The basement is the subconscious. Deep beneath the house is the collective unconscious, where dragons and monsters dwell. These are the complexes of the collective unconscious, the things that you need to face in order to mature as a human being. Tod Venn mentions the dragons and Shadow above. The village and traditional clothing also sounds as relating to the collective subconscious. I think Peterson would say that this relates to drives that are collective to us as humans, and sometimes older that Homo Sapiens. There is a conflict here between the feminine (the women) and a religious and/or patriarchal authority (clergy, your father). There appears to be a situation that is out of your control; the dancing on broken glass, closed gates, you are pushed around and don't know the moves. Maybe some kind of ecstatic feeling of being out of control. Maybe you need to learn to let go? There is also a conflict here; on the one hand you are trying to dance, on the other hand the clergy and your father are disapproving of you. You may want to contemplate this in relation to your relationship to your father. This may either refer to your actual father or be a symbol of a hierarchical way of thinking, especially as relating to religion and spirituality (considering the clergy). The part about the blood is also interesting, and I would advise you to contemplate it rather that try to give you an answer. My spontaneous associations are that blood is thicker than water, and also the passage in the Gospels where a Roman sticks a spear into the side of the crucified Christ, and both blood and water comes out (a scene which is closely related to baptism and the Mass), but these are my associations, not yours.",28-02-2022 11:20,405,391,,I woke up cold and anxious
179,520001791,"I was somehow involved in a murder. An acquaintance of ours (a big man) had beaten another man to death and a few of my friends and I had sort of egged him on over text message. The whole dream was the police surrounding us all, mostly old school friends, a toxic ex best friend of mine and a toxic ex boyfriend. Also my beloved grandma who has passed, had been involved! We were all surrounded by the police and about to be interrogated. I knew that if they saw my text messages or diary entries (I had a few journals lying around in a bag and in my hand etc), I was screwed. I was considering deleteting the messages or journal entries but didn't want to act like I was covering anything up. I was trying desperately to talk discreetly to my friends (with the police around us) to make sure we were on the same page about what we were going to say. I knew I was facing jail. Maybe 1-6 months. Or maybe none at all, but I was just hoping and praying I wouldn't go to jail. My main focus was my kids and them thinking I was the worst mum in the world for going to jail.

The natural tendency for us to repress aspects of our behavior interests me, and is obviously a function of the unconscious, like not allowing ourselves to be aggressive and let off steam, which can cause us to eventually explode like a pressure cooker etc. I wonder whether the violent behavior of the masculine symbol was so intolerable to you it made you act violently too. I wonder whether this is about the way you judge against the naturally repressed aspects of your own personality which have value, which the unconscious projects onto the masculine symbol here. Given the thug, this dream may relate to the initial stage of Animus integration, and given that you were involved in the killing of him, may speak to how you judge against and repress what he represented, in yourself. The killing may also imply a transition from the first stage, to the second stage of the development of your Animus. In the second stage the Animus, the symbolically masculine aspect of the female's personality is associated with forward planning, among other things, as you were in this dream.",28-01-2022 11:20,310,332,,This was one of those ones you wake up shaking from and SO glad it was only a dream.

I go to the end of the store, where the receptionist walks me through, she presents with her hands from the back of the store the view of the whole store into the front. Above me there is a broken escalator which captures my attention, I then look up and notice to my surprise that there are people up there but there is no way to enter the second level of this furnishing store.

Is the water clear? Fiance might be the dedication to this idea or part of you that lies in the coffin. Is it dead? Or a possibility to raise this from the dead, child sometimes means regression into something but it seems the ""movement"" into regression is missing. Did you felt that this fiance of your dreams was really your fiance? Some idea you want to put into rest in connection to her? Maybe even an important idea or possibility put into rest for now. Maybe its something you ""ought"" to be, or you think you have to be in front of the world and others (as its the part of the building that is on top thus most visible to others). You even say public but yours, or your view is out there but you have two?

Some observations… 3 water scoops, 3 coffins and 3 people you, your fiancé and his infant brother? The description of the water scoops is telling. First of all water in relation to a church belong to Christ. The building is made of people understand fully that water represents cleansing and washing. holy and without blemish. Notice the church is subject to Christ! Notice the water is the word of god that is used for washing our lives. The purpose of washing is that the church will be presented to Christ as holy and beautiful and virtuous. In your dream we notice the first scoop of water is in “polished wood”? This is meant to be for the washing of the church as God’s word is meditated upon and read daily his spirit makes it clean our conscience making us one with him. The wood represents the natural man who, in the church of Christ will go down into the waters of baptism and the natural man will die but ride again in Christ In the baroque style pagan church this is called holy water is Only for show, this is evident as “polished wood” is the description. Yes the church is highly polished to attract followers but the true meaning is lost in the polish. Religion is highly polished. The silver scoops in the bible speak of redemption and purification. The process of heating silver to burn off the dross and other imperfections is a metaphor used throughout Scripture. God’s Word itself is described in value beyond silver: “The promises of the LORD are pure, like silver refined in a furnace and purified seven times” (Ps 12:6). The purification process was sometimes used as a symbol for the way God tests and refines people: “You have tested us, O God. You have refined us in the same way silver is refined” (Ps 66:10; see also Isa 48:10). A silversmith would have to attentively watch the silver, getting it to just the right heat, in order to purify the metal. God also watches us as he put us through fiery trials, never leaving us for an instant and only allowing the situation to progress to the point where it is helpful for our sanctification. In the church of Venus the water and silver scoops are just for show however Venus may expect her followers to perform rituals suitable for her? What’s missing here is the gold of course which represents the golden nature of Jesus. Peter the disciple and apostle makes mention of silver and gold showing the true meaning of being washed in water and refined by fire.",28-12-2021 11:22,154,786,,

Large lifelike screen compare small Home Screen Possible adult viewing compare toy teddy bear. While I don’t understand all of this some things stand out? For me the cinema is a large screen that has the power to bring its movies/ entertainment to life for the viewer. You seem to understand this concept of the cinema as a mechanism that has the power to breathe life into what ever is fed into the projectors. To me the fact that you have stayed behind is to make use of this mechanism by turning it on yourself. You go there to see for yourself the larger than life screen, it’s intention is for informing and to entertain but somewhere along the line you have realized that by looking into something you can bring it to life just like the toy teddy bear at home on your tv. The toy teddy bear is a comfort to you it’s strength it’s warm fur can be your friend and companion as a toy is your friend howbeit lifeless. Bears are not mean or malicious; they are very gentle and tolerant animals. Mother bears are affectionate, protective, devoted, strict, sensitive and attentive with their young. Not unlike people, bears can be empathetic, fearful, joyful, playful, social and even altruistic. Her is what you see in the toy teddy bear perhaps but as you look at it begins to undergo a change something is happening that s bring it to life just from watching it on the tv? Your toy teddy bear is undergoing a change the monster within his breaking through this once lovable toy. The tv scene has taught you somehow there is a way to bring things to life except instead of bringing the best out of the lifeless toy the transformation of the toy teddy somehow brings out the monster ? Perhaps this intrigued you this transformation of the toy teddy it’s your teddy you should be able to control it right? Looking back at the cinema you understand the same idea that if the tv at home has the power to bring toys to life then how much more power does a larger than life cinema screen have to bring you to life to transform you into much more that you are? You go to the cinema with the idea of using its mechanism that is its projector and film tapes to film yourself and then project yourself onto the big screen. By filming yourself and projecting yourself onto the cinema screen you attempt to bring out the inner you to bring you to life that is what the cinema screen is designed to do. However just like the toy bear that is harmless and comforting a monstrous change takes place you find that you are now being chased around this cinema you know you shouldn’t be doing this transformation stuff but you can’t resist. Now that you have released your inner self and bought it to life via the mechanism of the cinema you find that it has released a monster just like the toy bear? It chased you why? Because you have miscalculated that you think you are in control but by circumventing natural methods of growth and try to release the inner and more powerful you like the bear seem to turn on yourself and it is no longer your friend no longer a comfort but in breathing life into something that’s not ready it turns on you. In summary it seems like you are dabbling with the inner self in ways that are not healthy for you, yes you discovered how to bring things to life but even doctor Frankenstein could do that. The way you go about indulging these transformations are merely mechanical there is no time for healthy integration no time to slowly grow into maturity just a quick fix and a flirt with nature that turns against you.",28-12-2021 11:22,131,871,,I woke up shaking with my heart hammering.

Just to clarify, I don't mean you should forgive her or think you really did forgive someone else for the same thing. I'm just taking a punt at what YOU might feel underneath, and if it's off base, no worries, I'm just wrong. I suspect that because it's a complicated issue, because there's a conflict between her guilt and victimhood, it's just difficult to know whether you should a. be angry with her for her guilt or b. forgive her because she's also another of your ex-husband's victims. I don't know either, but just to reassure you, those conflicting emotions are all normal and valid. IF you have any anger towards yourself, whether for being his victim, for not doing enough to keep the family together (that's a bullshit lie if you ever feel that), for not forgiving her (yet or IF you ever decide to), that anger is also valid in context of how difficult the situation is but also misplaced. Because you have been mistreated, partly by her, it makes perfect sense that you can't just forgive her casually, just because she's also a victim. It makes sense that you might feel like she's following you and blaming you or acting entitled to forgiveness automatically, because the confusion and hurt follow you. I would also suggest that you are a forgiving person, if you have a subconscious awareness of forgiving people for certain things, but it isn't as simple as that when you're the victim, particularly of betrayal *(the worst of all sins, if you will). You couldn't help and don't bare any responsibility for the fact that he was a dishonest, selfish bastard who couldn't keep his pants on or that she fell for things and didn't reject a married man.

Thoughts only..the 2 hours seem like the 2 women in your dream? One hour is a time, a time is descriptive of a certain time in each woman’s life. The dream now speaks of the time “away” from your ex highlighting what each woman is going through after married life. The 2 hours being connected are most likely the same woman 2 hours of time on the same clock so to speak. By looking at how each woman handles the situation we see opposites we see conflict as they finally both meet at the same home town in the same pub which is to say both women are in each other’s lives and now they intersect giving you greater understanding about yourself. You being the first woman, the wife do what most of us would do after a marriage break up, you go home to your hometown where it’s safe and secure. From there you slowly take time out to relax and slowly start to rebuild your social life with friends at the pub. The other woman being the mistress that’s what she feels like not truly married to the husband because you are the true wife but now you are not married the mistress is revealed to you. That is the other woman within you. That woman also needs attention. Notice she follows you to your home town that’s because she has to because it’s her home town as well. She unlike you is a professional dancer, instead of taking things slowly applying social patience she is out to drum up business for herself. While you are at a loss she’s getting paid for it. While you are sort of suffering she is marching forward. The pub is the apex where you finally meet the other woman, she’s not a mistress in real life she is the other part of you that has become the mistress because you were the wife and she was neglected. Now you are no longer the wife she is set free to find a husband for herself. Here is your conflict because it’s at the pub where the 2 hours meet and you begin to realize and start to feel for this mistress. You have suffered by your husband but she has suffered also by being relegated to mistress. The hour of your experience has given you empathy for others and you can understand how she might be feeling having been locked out of the relationship. You now empathize with her. At first you are shocked that this woman has followed you to your home town that is the other part of you is free and starting to be exposed to you now but now you begin to understand she has nowhere else to go. Her behaviour being a bit rowdy now begins to find acceptance with you. You really feel sorry for her. It’s a great story where after time you manage to forgive yourself while at the same time as being angry towards the ex you understand that the other woman was suffering while you were married. While you were married she suffered now that you are not married you are suffering. I see the gradual integration of the 2 women coming together.

As we progressed the water got clearer and clearer. I wanted to go back to the human world. I wanted to be human again, to taste human food again and live the joys of being human. Once we managed to emerge in the ocean, it was great. We swam near the surface. The other fish told me: ""now, if you want to go back, fishermen will arrive soon. Just let yourself be captured, it will be quick and you will be reborn in no time."" I felt uneasy. The idea of dying was not so great, after all. I tried to get as far away from the fishermen as possible.

I guess slightly less literal possibilities could include a death & rebirth of some aspect within the context of your current life. Or, perhaps it might relate to the the Age of Pisces we're currently all living through, which is nearing it's end as we head towards the Age of Aquarius. This could also have associations with religious symbolism relating to Jesus and the symbol of the fish. I was listening to Alan Watts yesterday, and he mentioned in passing his opinion that Jesus may very well have been a real person who had experiences of what Alan said ""we call cosmic consciousness"", and that Jesus had claimed that he was God incarnate. In Jungian terms this experience would be a psyche - or ego death. Your dream reminded me of this, and there is an aspect of your dream which I'd say is quite unusual in that your identity had shifted, that you were not ""you"", but a fish. So there are common themes of a revealed surprising nature of identity, death, rebirth, and the fish through both the biblical story and your dream. Interesting that you had not died and become a fish, at least within this dream, but were already a fish and were contemplating dying and being reborn as a human again, knowing that you were once human before. The waters clearing as you got further and further away from the human domain is also interesting. Swimming near the surface might be related to your then state of consciousness as you dreamed.",28-11-2021 11:22,247,306,,

Your Bison is clearly out of its natural habitat compared the young woman who seems more savy.The Bison’s world has been turned upside down and it’s legs tied up so that it cannot walk in its natural way. In fact your Bison is suspended between the 2 different worlds. One world being its natural territory where she is Queen the other being perhaps social environment where the other woman is in charge ? At first glance it’s almost a scene where the Animal is corralled in ready for slaughter. We see the leg ropes we see the metallic device which in a slaughter house is what’s known as a bolt gun. This is a metal device where the bolt protrudes into the animals head through the skull and then into the brains. That is what normally happens. But in your dream there seems to be a different picture, similar but different? The Bison is being abused by a group of people primarily by a young woman. But in this case the dream goes one step further in that the girl is taking advantage of this situation to simply prove to the “group” that she is as tough as they are but at the expense if the Bison. The Bison is out of its normal territory and subject to the others within the group because it is been overpowered by them. The Bison is on the line,suspended online by the ropes. If the Bison is online then we may understand the torture to be coming from the online group? The public display of ridicule is indeed torture to the Bison who is completely out of its depth and now helpless and unable to defend itself? The person who is torturing the Bison is described as an “abuser” who was “trying”to be “exceptionally cruel” this “trying” suggests she does not normally behave like that but for some reason in this case has a reason to try?",28-08-2021 11:24,145,404,,

In the dream the crocodile has two sides, two natures, oppositely related, the ideal way and the dangerous way. If it represents an aspect of you, the creature is also ancient, primal and comes up from below the waters depths, perhaps the unconscious, I see this as potentially all relating to the way of making the contents of the deep unconscious, conscious.

Also, sometimes it seems to be nighttime, when it's just that you're weary and not with the right company and rest. When you get the right company and rest, it feels more like daytime, because we have more energy, whether it is or isn't literally. I'd say make sure your mom knows you appreciate her too.

427,1721451638,"The sense of place has a strange feel to it despite the mundane descriptions. I'm in a city, I experience being aboard something like a stationary train or tram, I'm lacking a requirement to travel back on the train, I think I wish to buy a piece of cake before my return journey for some reason, but I'm trying to fish out my payment card and ID card and making other passengers wait, I see my bags on the floor unzipped, my belongings bulging out of them in an unorganized fashion as I fish around on my person for my cards, I feel the passengers impatience with me. Then I'm standing in something approximating a shopping mall, apparently attempting a different route of travel, standing in front of a phone with old fashioned handset in my hand like those of old phone boxes. I lift up the handset a couple of times, the unusual looking digital screen flickers slightly but fails to spring to life, I lift it a third time and the phone and display then connects successfully. I speak in a slightly shakey voice, stating that I wish to attain something, perhaps this cake I'm after by relaying my card details, to then travel back by alternative means, perhaps by car, and the natural sounding voice I recognize as artificial intelligence identifies by the sound of my voice that I am somehow unfit, as though drunk and intending to drive, only not that, and manages to deduce I'm breaching some rule in what I am asking, recognizing I must be traveling back by a method I'm unfit to do in this circumstance, based upon my request. I'm then elsewhere walking on some dim grey street, having traveled another different route, I see a person walking in front of me, I recognize them as a second instance of an identical person I've just seen at the opposite end of the road I'm walking down, beyond them I see an oddly distinct looking vehicle drive around the corner of a road, at that moment another identical vehicle drives around the same corner in the opposite direction. Then I find myself at a different scene, looking at a damaged, blackened decrepit shell of a helicopter leaning towards the edge of a small muddy pit of water beside it. I pan my head right and there is a small glass cubicle, like the glass cockpit of a crane or digger, with a man sat inside it. Beside him is a cake, he asks me what size slice I'd like, I gesture with my finger and thumb the thickness, but my hand is shakey, I worry this looks suspect somehow, I hold my hand with my other hand to steady it, struggling to indicate a sufficient thickness of slice. He serves me a slice of cake within two slices of bread, like a sandwich with some salad in it also. A bit odd, I thought. I took a bite, I sense the cool temperature of the salad. I ask the person that served me the cake 'what month were you born in?' as if to inquire his relatedness to me, as one might enquire to infer anothers zodiac sign. He says 'I was born in such-and-such a year', (I forget the actual year) clearly failing to understand the concept of a month, answering like a somewhat poorly programmed artificial intelligence humanoid. Then I'm in a car with this person and also my dad, setting off somewhere.

Some times the lady 86 would refer to 99 as Max. But when it was more serious she changed to his number, 99 same as James Bond, he was called James by his female counterparts but 007 referred to his special self.

Now that you’re 30 you look back at yourself as 21 and realize that time could have been better and needed to be changed, in real life you do set out to change from 21 to 30. Your dream conveys this to you as stopping that life and bringing it all to an end “I dreamed that I was about to be arrested and convicted” Normally after growing through to adult hood we would move on to the next stage of our life but in your case 21 needs to go before you can move on. For this to happen you need to be arrested that is in some way taken in to custody.. pulled up in some way and then having been pulled up then convicted about 21 and what it means to you. Once you’ve been “convicted” in your heart you can get on with it to a new start in life. You sort of know you need to do something because you say to yourself “I may have been getting ready to turn myself in” so there is thought and preparation involved about what you see as 21. You don’t really want to kill 21 because that’s who you are and neither does your mother. However you realize that you need to kill 21 because now you have a conviction in your heart that 21 needs to go so that you don’t need to be in this position at 30. You say you were in a position of “unintentionally” killing 21 people. Perhaps you were happy to continue your life as 21 until you were arrested and convicted in your heart that 21 needs to die/go.

We were putting on wetsuits. I asked another ""do I need to take my top off?"" before putting on the wetsuit, ""yes"".

Perhaps something that could be obtained if you initiate the efforts to get the means going by utilizing group support.",28-06-2021 11:27,652,251,"I had this dream after I'd already woken once, my sleeping pattern has been terrible this last year. Dreams I recall tend to occur in this time of light, broken sleep, somewhere between sleep and wake.",
527,1721451638,"I was at a beach, and there was an odd looking vehicle a bit like a tractor with its large back wheels, except this vehicle had no visible wheels at the front, and even larger rear wheels. I was aware that it was once above the sea level, on the sandy banks of the beach, but time had passed and I then witnessed it submerged just below the surface of the sea. I saw some people disappear below the water level and apparently get into the cabin, when it then rapidly, with unusual speed power and ease, reversed out of where it was submerged sunken in the sand offshore, back up onto the high sandy banks of the beach. Then this event was set back in time, ready to replay again, only with myself as an active participant in it, needing to prepare to do what I'd seen the people do - get into the cabin, and get the vehicle back out the sea onto the steep, sandy banks of the beach. There were a couple of odd scenes that were never seen or featured when I witnessed the first overview of events initially, I had a one half of a plastic clip like that found on a backpack or luggage (pictured), partly broken, which was presumably attached to the vehicle at one end, that I connected to the other half of the clip presumably attached to the sandy bank, one of the actual plastic clips was broken but I connected it to the other half precariously. I recall mentioning how seemingly ridiculous this feeble link was for the job at hand. Then, equally absurdly, I was handling some thin string which again might've been attached to the clip, which I was threading onto something fixed on the bank on the beach. Then was a sense of time urgency, and I along with a few others were standing atop the steep sandy banks of the beach, preparing to head to the sunken vehicle, submerge ourselves in the cold ocean and enter the cabin before getting the vehicle out from beneath the sea, where it was stuck deep into the sand, submerged. We were putting on wetsuits. I asked another ""do I need to take my top off?"" before putting on the wetsuit, ""yes"". Putting my arm into the sleeve of the suit I noticed just how thick the material was, several inches thick, enough to keep me from being shocked from the cold ocean temperature, so thick I might not even notice the temperature change at all.",11-07-2021 09:32,2,5,844542000000000,100001000000000,"The Tractor.: Maybe your conscience? It has no front wheels therefore it’s designed not to steer to the left or the right just forward and reverse and keep you on tracks d give you great traction. The 2 functions may simply be right wrong? The large wheels enable traction for daily life when applied daily. At the first the Tractor is anchored on solid ground by the sea (sub conscience) the tractor was originally above sea level where the conscience is supposed to be to help us out with our daily living to make good decisions on a daily basis. But over time time we notice the tractor has become submerged. What caused the tractor to get submerged? If the tractor is the conscience then it has a daily function to help us get through each day providing traction for our daily work? Then at night it rests as we sleep and the sub conscience takes over. This cycle is performed on a daily basis just like the sea. The sea also has a daily rhythm, the tide goes out the tide comes in each day. If the tractor is your conscience but not been in operation because of other activities then it will slowly cease to function. The tractor is anchored to the bank with a quick release clip so as to enable it to be unhitched with ease each day to drive into the sea and face the day? Then when the tide goes out again you simply reverse yourself back up onto the bank and rest until tomorrow till the new day begins and start all over again? But why is your tractor submerged? Again, if the tractor is your conscience it may well be you have neglected to come out and face some of your new days thus leaving your tractor anchored in the one place on the beach? It’s possible that the forces of nature of life itself have altered the mean level of the normal level of your tidal activity thereby flooding your tractor when not in use? When the tractor is in daily use we can be aware of the rising tide each day and make the appropriate adjustments of how far back you need to park it so that it doesn’t submerge when you awake ready for a new day? Having been neglected for some time (time passed) perhaps living in the past the tide has simply crept up on you because as you say yourself you’ve been “sleeping a lot lately) This sleeping may be a distraction causing you to miss the daily tides? The tractor needs to be above sea level not under it. You need it to sort through your daily life and of a night when the tide goes out your sub conscience will continue to assist you as you sleep? You can’t have the tractor submerged.This has happened before but you’ve seen what other people have done when this happens, they (perhaps your maintenance crew simply go in and perhaps give your tractor an overhaul so it can get started again. This may be seen as a wake up call to wake you up a bit? Once the machine has been serviced and running again it’s time for you to reverse it back to saftey up on the new tidal mark on the bank and as a safety precaution you might anchor it off until tomorrow comes when it is nice and rested waiting for the new and rising tide of the new day? This must be repeated daily. Once you miss a few tides you are then in danger of being submerged again.
The distraction that caused you to allow the Tractor to get submerged: Just a guess here but it’s possible that you’ve been spending a lot of time on your “dream life” the place is “idyllic” that is it seems perfect for you away from the daily rough and tumble of the sea? The place itself is in the countryside with a small building housing various crafts and pottery and it’s nice and sunny convenient to assist with the pottery? Here we possibly see the other end of your spectrum? On one hand the daily tides of life with the big decisions you need to make each day just to get through then on the other hand an ideal place in the country where you can sleep to your hearts content and be creative with your crafts and pottery in the sunny countryside. This setting is idyllic and well suited to you because the crafts relax you and you must feel at peace with yourself in this ideal setting (no big tractor here no big decisions) this idyllic place is so peaceful for you that it has caused you to sleep too much, loosing time away from the real world possibly because you may need a certain amount of rest in your life.
The plastic clip: This is a quick release mechanism designed to be secured and unsecured with ease. The original old tractors had their implements bolted on and it was hard going to change them so they just left them on rendering the use of the tractor to only one job. Then came the 3 point Linkage set up, then what is called the quick hitch set up which allowed the operator to change the function of the tractor very quickly making it a more versatile peice of equipment all because of the quick hitch system. So to we see your quick hitch system in the plastic clip? I’m still trying to figure this out but even as you yourself have noticed that the plastic clip and piece of string is far too feeble to hold back the big tractor? I’m just wondering about the crafts and pottery, what they represent to you? This idyllic project seems to have the effect of at least trying to anchor your tractor from moving sometimes? Your distraction may be seen as in the string as your attachment to your crafts using it to anchor your conscience to save it from entering the new day and making the decisions needed to get through the day in other words it gives the conscience a break, a rest. Even though the tractor is very powerful and provides all the traction we need to get through each day it still needs to be used, it cannot be neglected. The plastic clip and piece of string may be your connection to your very relaxing crafts and pottery and as we realise is not strong enough to stop the tractor from becoming submerged should the rising tide come in higher than the average? It does provide great traction for life only when it is in operation each day? It’s possible your dream is showing you about balance by showing you how easy it is to disengage from one part of your life so that you don’t suffer loss in another part of your life??? If this is so then your dream is asking you to keep and eye on the daily tides and be prepared for them each day when they come in. Also not to over indulge in the idyllic sunny countryside when you get too much relaxation and fall asleep??? Eves comments on the wetsuit to keep you from getting too much of a shock when you decide to “ dive in” and retrieve your tractor are great.
The clip and the string: The string may represent your tie to crafts and art and is seen as your attempt to create a relaxing connection to anchor the tractor. The plastic quick release although manufactured from natural products has undergone a lot of change just like the new and modern quick hitch system for the tractor. This modern and clever little clip allows you to quickly change your needed connection to be appropriately involved in the changing rhythm of your days. The tractor can be used for many purposes when it connects the right implements. Your little plastic clip cannot always hold the tractor back. It’s designed to unclip as well but when the time is right quickly and effortlessly clip back up again.",28-06-2021 11:27,652,661,,
542,1721451638,"First, a scene involving a pedal bike, in working order though slightly haphazard condition, the chain nearly came off but didn't, oil was needed, vegetable oil was suggested. Next, my dad was fiddling with a newly rewired, large electrical box he'd constructed. I made a statement of it being 'the most complex for a simple operation', my dad replied that it was all good except 'occasionally doesn't work' at all. This I think was set in my childhood home, which has a workshop/studio room. Either my dad or myself commented on a cover of a plug socket being rather dirty, but on closer inspection the clear plastic cover which was semi translucent wasn't because it was dirty, but because it was the type of plastic which was glow in the dark when charged up by placing it near light first. For a good deal of time I was wandering around trying to find a light bulb to hold this piece of plastic near to see it glow, I never was able to find one. As I did, the small workshop room became a vast room the size of a large field with many people spread around the far perimeters engaged in a variety of very different activities. Next scene, I'm at a table, outside somewhere else, with my mum and several others sat around it. My mouth feels uncomfortable and I retrieve a selection of small brown beads threaded onto on strings from my mouth. My mum makes jewelry in real life, though unlike these beads, I say 'i haven't even seen these ones before'. A sour faced woman appeared and takes her place where I was sitting, I make a joking comment to the effect of it being okay for me to have stolen her place. She sits down, I stand beside the table. I look off to the side and see through the hedge a set of decorative stone stairs which look like an ancient oriental entrance to a temple. Then an oriental spiritual master of some sort with a dead pan expression arrives at the table and sits at the head. Then, outside again, in some different place, a town in England.. I look at a wall leading along the side of an alley which led to an opening to a street below, it has a sign pinned on part of it with some words I forget now. As I look at it it was like a sped up timelapse occurred and the sign weathered away, deteriorated, became illegible and disappeared. The passageway beside that wall then got covered over by buildings, I sensed the route/passage had been moved to the right somewhat, like I'd witnessed the development of a town layout change over time. I then find myself stood nearby beside my sister, still atop the slight hill in a town, I was standing in a slightly puffed up imposing way, again aware of beads in my mouth, fetching a few more up. Some people walked by, I recognised the voice of a rapper who I listened to years ago, he was rhyming aloud, I felt my mood change from my fake imposing demeanor to a happy interested one, the rapper walked on around the corner, and one of his crew, a tall guy said I should call him and get in touch.",10-07-2021 04:54,,1,841343000000000,1043123267,"There are a lot of details to consider here!

561,100009000000000,"Last night I dreamed that me and a 3 others were sent to a jungle to kill a boa that had been killing the locals of a village. It was me, our guide, a woman, and a hunter. We found a cave to camp in as a home base for our operation and went searching for it. We searched for days but found nothing. The woman’s car had a camera on her trunk. One day as she was backing up, her car couldn’t move. All she saw in the back camera were two large glowing orbs. She came back to us with this information. The guide then proclaimed loudly “IT IS THE BOA!” Then he shapeshifted into the snake and tried to kill us.",29-06-2021 16:05,0,5,836396000000000,100001000000000,"The shape shifting guide! You have Hand picked an interesting team. Yourself on order to fix the problem. The guide who would be expected to be a native who should have the locals interests at heart a person who understands how they live in balance with the land. The woman who ends up using her female intuition to see into the spiritual realm to actually find the boa. The hunter who is possibly a hired professional who has skills to track the boa and although not mentioned but inferred he does do what he is hired to do when it becomes apparent who the real snake is. By using conventional methods your team failed to find the boa. It was the woman using the attached reversing camera to see the 2 orbs that eventually exposed the snake. Your team was going forward each day to hunt and track the boa with no success because the boa left no tracks in the jungle because he is a shape shifting spirit. The camera: Just as those wishing to find specific wildlife to make a documentary make use of a camera yogi d them, the likewise drives in reverse thereby using the camera mounted in her vehicle as a searchlight after she can’t gi any further she looks into the camera only to find the real boa, the native and harmless boa. Notice the words if the the guide who is a snake he exclaims loudly “IT IS THE BOA” these harmless boa are the true guardians and guides of the land. By using the camera she has proof that these harmless boa are different from a rogue snake. As a woman she senses that these orbs want to protect the environment to nurture their young as a woman protects and nurtured her young. her young. The boa is not a threat to humans in fact the boa is sometimes used in harmony with villages and communities etc to help rid them of too many rats and mice etc. The boa in your dream is said to have killed the villagers more than likely this boa is an introduced species, a hybrid when introduced to an area can be too much competition to the local species by taking all their food and ruining the local habitat similar to feral cats in Australia which wipe out all the local wildlife in this case it’s also disrupting the villagers as well because the economic balance upon the land and wildlife is disrupted by the introduced boa who out competes the wildlife which in turn has drastic effects upon the villagers.
The guide: A good guide would likely be a local,someone familiar with the villagers and the surrounding land. he would act on behalf of the villagers and the local wildlife by educating people like Richard Attenborough does. This guide is a snake that is disguised as a boa, notice of the orbs he calls them the boa but he changes his shape into a snake? They are both very different in their nature but up until now he has fooled the community into thinking it is the boa doing all the damage. This guide is not a native boa who represent no threat to the villagers he is the cause of them loosing their livelihoods. Being the guide he is supposed to understand the fine balance and harmony of nature with the villagers as they cohabit together. This boa behaves at odds to the native boa who keep the land clean of too many rats and mice without damaging the Environment which is good for the villagers. This introduced hybrid boa is the opposite in his behavior, looks like a boa but is a rogue snake. He takes advantage of this simple harmony that exists between the balanced community and the land and its inhabitants? he is selling them short. He acts like a guide but inside he is a snake, a hybrid snake, a feral snake, a wild snake without proper thought to the economic balance of nature. he has no qualms about selling his people out and when confronted, quickly changes shape to his true identity which of course is a feral snake,not a boa! I say feral because the boa does not represent a threat to man it is the other way around it is men who use their boa skin for bags etc. this snake is a feral snake who has ruined the habitat and the lively hood of the villagers. The orbs have not threatened the woman they have revealed themselves as the true guides of the land? When confronted with this revelation the false guide changes from a guide to a feral snake wanting to also kill the team because they have exposed him? At first he says they are the boa and then he turns into a snake. The orbs possibly the villagers and the boa are the true guides of the land who have looked after the land by their balanced lifestyle but now that balance is being ruined by the feral snake. The real boa rid the land of too many and unwanted rats and mice now take it upon themselves to expose the false guide allowing themselves to be filmed by the camera which provides proof of how they live, proof that they have not damaged the land neither each other! the villagers loose their livelihoods because of bad land practise The feral snake was easily able to disguise himself as a local boa supposedly harmless but beneficial. The local and native boa only live harmoniously and contributes to the well being of all they are true keepers of the Enviroment. They were also able to expose the fake boa as a snake! The nature of the feral snake is to kill by the damage he causes to the Enviroment. However the nature of the hunter within the team is also to kill but not as a feral but in a controlled atmosphere, that is when he finds the feral snake he will certainly kill it!
Looking at the Team again: Whoever choose the team was very clever. The snake disguised as the boa was initially chosen as part of the team possibly so that it could be exposed. the identity of the snake is suspected from the start but proof is required! The woman member of the team provides this proof by use of her wildlife camera attached to her vehicle. She finds the orbs who are the true boa as the snake guide himself loudly exclaims.. “ they are the boa”She has the evidence and also tricked the snake into a confession. Once the proof is exhibited the guide can no longer masquerade as a harmless boa therefore his only option is to shift back to his true self which is the snake. As the snake changes back to its true intentions he wants to kill them however the Hunter who up until now has not been able to do his job properly because he was looking for boa not a feral snake. He could not find the boa because they had retreated into the jungle but now he sees them in the camera and realizes the boa are not at fault but the snake is the rogue guide. Now that the hunter has been provided the correct information he can now hunt accordingly to set a trap for the snake which is different from the boa.
Comparing the snake serpent biblically: The snake in the bible is similar to the snake in your dream. The biblical serpent dress’s itself up as a Christian nice long robes declaring itself as a guide to humanity all the while ruining the balance and relationship with man and God. In your dream the snake and the boa are of the same species but are totally different. The boa cares for the land and its inhabitants just like the Christian does but the Christian is often like the boa in your dream blamed for the damage the snake has caused. The snake in the bible will be exposed as a snake a deceiver and a liar even though it it dressed in beautiful robes it will be cast down. The color of the Christian is white not purple which tends to dazzle and seduce its prey a said higher enlightenment. The Christian like the villagers in your dream live a simple existence with the owner of the land and the wildlife around it. The snake on the other hand damages that very existence by treachery using trickery to entice its prey to fall from harmony with the creator. The biblical snake is a feral Christian and will loose its place as it is also exposed as its deeds are bought to light by the woman’s / church’s proof which she will bring to the others/ the world. Then the world will see that this snake guide is not a god but only a man, a treacherous man that has caused a lot of damage.",28-06-2021 11:28,152,460,,

She looks down at my books, noticing a black and white photo and a headline concerning esotericism and the arts. She smiles slightly and as she starts the lesson, she asks me if I can name a 19th century writer heavily inspired by the occult",20-06-2021 20:34,0,2,829875000000000,100001000000000,"You are studying literature in between your work schedule. This week you need to study to find the answers, next week you need to be fully competent with what you have learned. Literature: What Is Literature? Simply put, literature represents the culture and tradition of a language or a people. Perhaps on one hand (as seen in the black and white photo) you desire to study the traditions of your culture Eg literature. On the other hand you you seem to be combining your cultural and traditional study which another side of your literature (again see black and white) The white side of your study is open to all and perhaps public. The black side absorbs from the white side therefore I say you are combining your study of traditional literature with deeper aspects connected to this study. As your literature class is starting we find you have “your books” perhaps the dark/black side of learning combined with what is being taught at your class the white side. “Your books are turned over so that the titles and authors are not exactly “visible” this is to hide your deeper study of literature and expand it to the occult. Some of “your books” are “open” allowing others to know a little about you. The titles are not visible but your teacher knows what you are studying just by looking at them because she is familiar with them even without knowing the titles or authors. The teacher understands the significance of the black and white photo on your open book. Some parts of your study are open but other parts are not yet fully disclosed Just as the photo is black and white so also is the way you are learning and so also is the teacher teaching. The headline in the photo “esotericism and the arts”. Esotericism is about secret knowledge for a small group of people.[1] Esotericism also describes mystical, spiritual or occult viewpoints (point of view).[2] Esotericism studies Gnosticism, Yoga, Alchemy, Magic, Spiritualism, Hypnosis, Astrology, Meditation, Mysticism, and Occultism. Many[who?] followers of Abrahamic faiths, particularly Christianity and Islam, have criticized Esotericism as black magic.[source?] Esotericism in religion is called ""obscurantism"". Esotericism can also be about understanding symbolism and hidden meanings of many different books. They include religious books, philosophy books and books about history. They use these books as their texts.[3] So we see the dark and black side perhaps as occultism and black magic? What you are wanting to study on the black side is much more than your traditional culture. The teacher begins her class with a question? “Can you name a 19th century writer that was heavily inspired by the Occult?” You possibly can because you have your books there which she probably knows what they are? Not sure about this but by naming the author will reveal what you have learned “Can you name them” she’s asking you make known the titles of your books that you have hidden on your desk? Perhaps by naming them they are integrated from the black side and more to the white side?",28-06-2021 11:29,113,965,,

THE SHORT BLACK DRESS
In your dream your grandmother has died and while reflecting on her life you are caused to reflect on your own life through your father who is also sorting and packing in the same house. As you sort through looking for your own things and perhaps anything from your grandmother and reflect on the articles your father approached you and asks you “if you are ready yet” in other words you should be ready by now because you’ve had enough time?He does manage to cause you to become self conscious when he points out that “you are wearing a new short black dress. Maybe your father represents God and tries to point out that you cannot fully respect the dead the way you are dressed baring too much skin The cardboard box is lifeless and may represent your grandmother or the religion she is connected to? The trunk is possibly you, the natural timber still alive with a larger capacity to store things. You are dressed in black for morning the death of your grandmother and take your time to absorb what she may be passing on to you? The new dress may be a new experience for you, death what does it really mean? Contained within the articles are things meant for you but to understand exactly what they are and what they mean you need “time” to reflect on the articles. But now your father wants to go and he asks you “are you ready to leave” But you are definitely not ready to leave “and ask him for more time”. At this point he notices your “short black skirt” possibly suggesting that even though you are dressed as for morning you are not that serious, but as you sort through and reflect you actually do start to become serious about it. Here we notice your “short skirt” it does at first seem respectable enough but as your father noticeably points out it’s “short” makes you more self conscious and aware especially since you are in the reflecting mode and now you start to question yourself. Your life up to now has been short and there has been no time to reflect upon it until now. Your fathers observation has pricked your conscience suggesting your behavior is irreverent. Before you never had time however the death of your grandmother affords you the necessary time you need to reflect on your short life and perhaps if you are patient and take more “time” and see if you can find some answers within your grandmothers things. The cardboard box has things you need to look at. The dinning table is a place to gather, your thoughts and share emotions and of reflect on life. This is important now and you realize by the way you are dressed your father might be right? You realize you need more “time” time to find answers and time to reflect and time to find the goodness within your grandmother. At your request your father goes off to continue packing so as to give you more “time”.

THE GREEN MINI SKIRT
The 3rd skirt is in fact a “mini skirt” Green and according to Carole Heffner the Catholic meaning for the green color is of ORDINARY TIME the time between the feasts how interesting again the word “time” comes up. Let’s see where this leads us as I must admit I’m not sure where this is going yet? Your second dream now finds you standing in front of a big door in a city with some students? So we see the big/broad gate in your dream which suggests that many have entered by this way, however your group is a group of students? Students study. First we saw reflection the contemplation now actual study. The black and white pictures suggest the old history of the great church and what will your group find? To help us understand that perhaps we should look at the green mini skirt? First we see the length is not only short like the others but “mini” and this style like the others can be paired with leg-inns and also for warmth. The mini skirt is designed to bare a lot of skin and became prominent in the 1960s but what has this got to do with your group of students and the big gate? Well it seems at this period of time the mini skirt is related to the feminist movement and more a time of women’s liberation, the mini skirt also relates to the retaining of youthfulness as well as a protest against male authority. Green is the color of healing and nature. The ordinary time described by Carol of the Catholic Church a time between feasts almost says that in between these feasts there is a time when people tend to forget about Gods timetable and quickly forget and start getting involved in what they feel is more important to them. Moses experienced the same thing as he was gone longer than expected the people rose up to play they forgot about God not realizing there is still more to come. The feminist movement and the barring of there skin are acts of the flesh and because they indulge in these thing they don’t realize their TIME IS RUNNING OUT

YOU SHOUT AT YOUR FATHER
After you find the KEY your father comes back after a few hours and he is noticeably annoyed? If Your father represents God why then is he annoyed? He caused you to contemplate right? He caused you to find the KEY right? You do have the the key of life right?
He seems annoyed that you are now taking so much “Time” but this is Now the fathers time you are taking God has at great cost provided you with the Key of Life Christ his son whom religion has rejected. Of course the Father is annoyed and entitled to ask “if you are ready now” after all he has just given you the keys to the kingdom therefore it is TIME to be ready. You tell him you are done and ready to go home with him. But on the eat home you begin to argue with him. You have not recognized the father in your dream he is the one who gave you time to find the key of Peter. He’s there but you don’t see it and begin to fight with him. You give him an ultimatum declaring you can find your own way home and don’t really need him. Our father is here as the great Sheppard we are all as lost sheep and he as the great Sheppard making sure you find your way home. As you are being driven home you say he rants about how much “time” you took. The rang is probably the message of the gospel telling you that now is the time? 
As you reach your parents house you shout and argue you are not listening, you had an experience but you are not aware of how he is so willing to show up in your life to help you.
Unfortunately it gets worse! As he gets you home you begin a new tirade by telling him (Jesus) that he should be grateful to you! You have not noticed how patient he was with you waiting for you all this time to find the KEY to life but now you treat him badly. You make him out as miserable and impatient but in fact he has been patient and understanding and he has given you much time to sort yourself out! Your ungratefulness is even more apparent when you now tell him that he has gotten all this work done today because of you and that he should thank you for it!
This again reveals your spiritual condition yet he seems so to persevere with you after all he is your father and loves you so.
Your father now looks confused and rightfully asked you why should he be grateful to you after all he is the one who died for you not you for him.
This question is designed to awaken your consciousness again but still you’re not seeing it?
As you wake up a cat walks over your chest. I don’t really know except that when a cat walks over you it wants attention but we need to realize we can’t keep walking over Christ to get his attention

The road takes you on a pathway to a new place however it’s the journey that is highlighted here. Your dream and your comments reveal 2 figures who have some understanding about snakes. You have said that “I’ve encountered snakes in my last job”. As well the bird in her job also encounters snakes in her job. The bird knows her job with snakes well. She doesn’t muck around she attacks the seemingly small snake 3 times. Let’s look. Firstly she reveals the snake “hiding in the grass” the bird takes no chances she will either eat the snake or act protectively since she knows the snake is a threat to her family. You on the other hand look at the snake and because of its small size deem it harmless. Note the difference between you and the bird. The next thing we notice is what happens in the pursuing 3 attacks. On the first attack the birds keen eye for danger reveals the hiding place of the snake “the short grass” which is beside the road you use to take this new journey. The short grass suggests it’s drought resistant quality however not quite enough coverage to escape the keen eyesight of the bird who is always on guard. The bird is teaching you what to look for and how to behave on your journey since the small size does not cause her to see the snake as harmless. The bird attacks the first time but the snake by changing its shape manages to find a way out of the birds beak. The snakes is adaptable firstly hiding in short grass then when cornered simply twisting itself or changes its shape to release itself. The second attack is different, the bird and the snake struggle but the “harmless snake” actually bites the bird causing the bird to drop the snake in front of you. Now the snake is fully exposed right in front of your eyes and what does it do, it now bites you because as as the bird is a threat so too are you a potential threat but unlike the bird you still see the snake as harmless until you also get bitten. So I said the bird is teaching you not to see the small snake as entirely harmless. The bird attacks the snake for the third time after having bitten both of you and still the struggle goes on. In your last job, before you climbed the stairs you worked with snakes enough to know that small snakes don’t pose a real threat however after you climb to the staircase you still apply the same logic in the same old way but the behaviour of the bird now teaches you something new, that is in your new life journey you might consider that even small snakes can hide in short grass and still have the capacity to bite especially once they are exposed.",28-05-2021 11:35,160,569,,

You do have a destination but it’s on an unseen shore, somewhere. It’s not that you don’t know where you’re going because you do, it’s just at the moment unseen, and it’s not like it’s nowhere in fact it is somewhere, it is a real place you have set off towards. It’s the way you are getting there that is the question not how because we know how, it’s on the big ship, organization? You are sitting on top of the load because you are responsible to make sure this load of hay reaches its destination. The how you reach and arrive suggests it will be by faith. The supplies and transport you are already a part of but the journey into the destination is unseen suggesting it is a journey by faith. Notice the “voice” that you “sense” of someone not seen in the dream as compared to the “words” of your own dismissing this “suggestion”. Notice the battle going on in your mind? You have set out on a journey with a load of supplies/hay and you are responsible to see that it arrives safely at this unseen destination. But now doubt sets in as we see your senses making suggestions to you that it’s perhaps a waste of time because there’s only goats at your destination again suggesting it’s a waste of good supplies just for a population/ group of goats? This creates doubt and the thoughts are activated by fear. Let’s look at how you turn the battle, after you “sense” the “voice” you now “hear” “words” This is very different because your words are containers also and they contain faith and with this faith you dismiss the “incorrect notion” that “someone else had made” This is a battle going on in your mind you set out with confidence you set out with supplies for sheep and cattle because they are the ones who more likely feed on hay although goats eat hay they mainly forage not graze. So the doubt that someone is trying to place inside your head is that the group you are sending supplies to are not even worthy of the supplies/vast amount of nutritious food. You correct this foolish notion with words not senseless notions. You overcome your struggle to reach your destination where in fact where there are no goats. So then if you have reached your destination who then is the vast amount of hay/nutritious food for?

So now we have an exciting and unusual dog who comes from far away and is naturally meant to be helpful and friendly to people in your neighborhood, we don't yet know if this dog has a bite to it? (maybe by now you know who the yellow dog is? The lioness meaning is the model for a woman, shes magnificent full of passion and beauty her presence is commanding and she protects her young. they are independent fierce loyal and brave and they are the primary hunters for their pride. As with the dog who is given a descriptive yellow colour the lioness also is given us further description. The biting down affectionately, without hurting you seems to be what a lioness would do to lovingly carry her young with her teeth without hurting them. The next thing we see is you snuggling into the lioness, shes a loving mother and you are her cub. but now we see that this fierce mother figure who is protective of her cubs and bites without hurting has your hand in its mouth. And yet she is not biting to hurt, she was affectionate. what is she doing? It does seem she is leading you? its possible that you have become a dog handler now your lioness is handling you in the right direction perhaps. you can be sure of this as compared with the exotic dog where you don't really know what to expect? the idea i get here is that i wouldn't be too trusting to allow the yellow dog to have your hand in its mouth? This affectionate scene reminds you of the house cat perhaps your real mother who used to do the same thing to play bite while all the while protecting you. You are conscious of other people watching, perhaps they think the treatment you are getting is over the top but you assure them its quite ok.A t the last we see the lioness tightening her grip on you you but still not hurting you. So here it is its a ""struggle"" for you and as you continue to struggle your lioness continues to tighten her hold on your arm.

There were also many TVs and electronics that were there that never had been. I had come down to work on them, but also to escape some rowdy party going on upstairs. A girl came down, who happened to be a girl I had a crush on back in high school, and she started talking to me. I did my best to ignore her and focus on my work, but I eventually started hesitantly talking back. Before I knew it, we were running around the basement, playing with toys, flinging ping pong balls at each other. We started to get closer and closer, though I kept my distance best I could. I began to desire her, and our lips kept getting closer, but I stopped myself each time because I knew she had a boyfriend. Two of her friends showed up, people I hadn’t gotten along with in real life, but got along fine with in the dream. Eventually i felt it was time to go, so I decided to say goodbye and end our game. One of my crush’s friends said to her, “would you like to steal a kiss before we go?” My crush looked at me, and we shared a soft peck on the lips.

You were down in the childhood basement avoiding the loud sound of the party upstairs and actively rewiring your connection to the past.

She was dressed in a very simple way, her clothes were light blue and pink. She was a magician. She invited me to join a club she belonged to herself. In this club magicians could meet, talk, spend time together. I was tempted to join, but I was not ready to commit myself, because that would mean I'd have to attend the first meeting immediately, so I just said I would consider it for next time.

You say she was cute: attractive in a dainty way, appealing, delightful, charming. Acquired some cute mannerisms etc The blond girl is in fact a young woman this is what you find appealing, she’s not a Marilyn Monroe neither is she a dumb blonde( as the saying goes) but she is a young woman and innocent and the blonde hair represents her fair skin. To you you have found a woman untarnished by worldly living. She is appealing because with you she will continue to grow untainted such as the many beauties you refer to. These beauties also have many qualities such as shape, color or form that pleases the senses. Notice your young woman is fair this is what really appeals to you rather than exotic colors etc. You are not so much looking to please the outward senses rather you are looking for inner content and satisfaction. However in this case this young girl is a witch/ magician. Even the way she is dresses is not loud or outlandish, the colors are there but again they are fair colors again suggesting an innocence “she is dressed in a simple way” there are many meanings for the colors however the simplistic meaning may suggest this simple young woman is thinking of marriage and a family the blue for a boy the pink for a girl if this is the case then marriage and children appeal more to you than temporary relationships. She was a Magician, as described a witch an illusionist. This sweet young girl is casting her spell over you, beware! Now that she has got your attention she takes her next step, not to come home and meet the family, no, but to join her club, the Magicians club, it’s here where she wants to marry you in, beware again! She belonged to this club not just a member but “belonging”suggesting something far more e.g. a generational thing with rules and codes etc, a place to socialize with other like minded people to discuss methods to ply their trade. A place to “meet” this is what she wants a place to meet, a place to join to get her. YOU ARE TEMPTED to join. Please note very clearly your dream has turned from appealing to TEMPTATION. You were not ready because you were not ready to commit. You were tempted to just go there no strings attached. The strings of attachment on the first meeting would obviously mean having your name published in the membership and first of all learning the new magical skills as an induction process of which you probably don’t agree with. You said you would consider it the next time meaning that the temptation for the young woman is still there, unfortunately you can’t seperate the appealing young woman from the magical witch.

However your dream is simply giving you a view of what might be going on within you at this time. You say it’s a nightmare for you and right from the start we understand that your dream is giving you a glimpse into what you normally wouldn’t perceive since the suggestion is this part of your life is in darkness but what is now revealed by your dream at first seems frightening simply because you previously could not see/perceive it. Before we start it would be helpful to understand from my perspective that we all experience inner conflict.  Look at this, another law, another way, waging war against you waging war against your mind with the purpose of taking you captive. This happens to us all through temptation to various things which we should know better. Looking at your dream again we see your villain is running away from the heroes, he’s been caught out now whereas before he/she was lurking in the unseen darkness gently deceiving you at first but now your dream has exposed the villain within and he’s on the run, he wants to hide from all this light you are subjecting him to, but he can’t because you’ve reached a point where you are determined to chase down this villain. So on one hand your villain is become exposed on the other hand you are not comfortable at realizing there is actually a villain lurking within whose purpose is to bring you into captivity and steal your vehicle. Now you realize that you must actively engage to take this villain into your captivity, reign him in!  The car here is probably your outward every Day body/vehicle and you are a driven type of person seems obvious. You have the drive to go forward in your immediate world whatever that is eg business/ sports whatever? You are driven! In your dream your world identifies with grand theft auto? From memory elite vehicles have been shopped and stolen for a specific customer who really likes and want that style of vehicle, they are willing to pay for it. Here’s the thing, it does seem like you are an elite person of sorts your vehicle holds a special place of interest designed to move fast in the company of elite vehicles similar to yourself. You have perfected the design and you are now sought after by others within your familiar life. But now we see the villain entering in to steal away your vehicle just like in grand theft auto where the owner has perfected his ability to design his life the way he wants and make his vehicle streamlined to suit his own particular purpose only to find to his dismay the villain the thief who has done no such work but simply comes along to steal your car, your streamlined vehicle that was designed by you to suit a specific purpose. So now we can see you as the hero and the villain, the hero as one who puts in all the design work and produces a streamlined vehicle and you also as the villain want into to steal the car away simply to sell it to the highest bidder (grand theft auto) You are perhaps young and don’t understand this concept, your streamlined vehicle was made that way by vigilant had work according to the law of your mind. The villain is the thief who see’s the beautiful vehicle and has done nothing to make it great and elite and simply steals it from you. So far your dream is showing you to take good care of the vehicle you have produced because the thief is always looking to steal it from you. You are not the thief as you so describe yourself “ you do not normally speed etc because you are a careful and thoughtful and you don’t break the law you are not not reckless with your vehicle, each of us need to at some time need to contend. with this situation because we are so given to conditioning ourselves we don’t notice other thoughts creeping in, and this I bother thief creeps into your life, while you are busy conditioning yourself you don’t notice him gradually sneaking in. By stealing your vehicle (GTA) he will only destroy what you have created. Here we see your villain warring against your good mind trying to derail you and eventually sell your vehicle for gain rather than use it for what you originally designed it for.
Your villain now realises the cops (your conscience) are chasing him up, that’s why he’s running, he’s a thief and he’s stealing your vehicle and as all good cars have an anti theft device so too does your conscience alert you to the attempted theft of your streamlined vehicle.you understand a criminal act is in progress you are alerted by your cops, police etc friends groups etc something is not right something criminal is taking place?
You are not a criminal you are not reckless but now the criminal within you must remember does not live by the same laws as you live by, remember he is lurking in the darkness and warring against your good mind and he’s waiting for an opportunity to steal your good work.
Your villain is criminally minded that is he breaks all the good laws that you abide by.

I knew things weren't right when through my window I saw the CN Tower had been erected in Montreal (Canadian dreams, eh?) and my first thought was 'the bomb is about to drop'. But as I fled the house, there it was, stuck on the roof like a fly on shit. I knew I wasn't safe in the open, so I tried to scare it away by shouting and throwing rocks. This only got its attention. The beast took to the air and swooped down at me. I was holding only a knife in my left hand, and as I barred the entry to my (late) father's house I tried to slash at the massive head pushing its way through the door. Luckily the skin was soft, not scaly, but still I could not do more than make it angry. When it finally forced its way in, what followed was a blur. For a few moments I tried to face it head on, taking advantage of the narrow hallway that slowed its penetration into my sanctum, but it was only a matter of time before it reached my father's room. I cannot recount all the details, you know how dreams go, but in a final desperate act I ducked into the bathroom and hid behind the door. As the dragon pushed his head into the tiny room I took advantage of the angle to thrust the knife under its chin and tore along the throat spilling so much black blood and offal that it threatened to drown me in dragon slag.",07-03-2021 15:48,3,5,773527000000000,100001000000000,"This doesn’t sound like the story of a hero who slays the dragon. There’s no hero and no genuine fire breathing dragon, just a slimy oversized worm fleshy with no snorts of fire, the boy also does not slay the dragon with a magnificent sword alas only a knife to slice the putrid flesh. Outside you are concerned about a potential explosion about to happen and as you attempt to flee the impending danger you notice on the inside the putrid slimy worm stuck to the ceiling. By contrast There is imminent danger outside and imminent danger inside. Outside is not safe, inside is not safe. The fly you mention is not only feeding on poop but also laying it’s eggs on the organic matter. The fly and the poop of course is most unbecoming for you so you try to scare, frighten it of with only rocks and shouting which of course only unsettles it’s feeding/egg laying which off course infuriates this dragon worm. The CN tower was at one stage the worlds largest tower and now considered one of the 7 wonders of the world by engineers. This tower has continually been outgrown by new buildings and in your dream in danger Of a bomb to explode it. The bomb may represent the explosion of higher towers surrounding it making it in danger of not being able to utilize its communication antennae? Perhaps this magnificent building represents your father? Your building by comparison is in danger of being outgrown or rather ingrown with your dragon worm breeding itself within your tower threatening to make you also obsolete. You see and understand the impending doom confronting the CN Tower outside facing the explosion of surrounding growth and now you are beginning to understand the imminent danger of the breeding dragon worms within your building. Your dragon worm has already grown to the point that your normal tactics of hurling small hurling small stones aren’t really working anymore frightening it by shouting also proves ineffective? Now you are forced to go one better, the knife with a keen cutting edge perhaps the tongue is used to slice strips off your Dragon worm. You barre entry to your late fathers house knowing perhaps that you don’t stand a chance if the 2 were to team up against you. Her we see a war of words and arguments your tongue etc used as a knife and you holding your knife under your fathers chin and when you succeed to make the cut all the bad blood between you both are exposed and you are covered in the slag drowning in it. You yourself speak of a confrontation and this seems true but now we see details of bad blood between the 2 of you the small rocks the shouting the piecing knife like tongue. This dragon is dead but it lives in filth somewhere in your soul. You mention the dark memories, memories which attempt to revive the dragon and stir up the old arguments. Not only did you fight with your father but you say yourself that it’s also difficult to take on his mantle which is a problem in addition to the bad blood between the 2 of you. Notice the CN building how it’s communication was outgrown by taller buildings so your communication in danger of exploding as the dragon kept getting bigger and bigger and now beginning to fester. My 2 cents.. on your part there is a lot of humility and grace required to forgive your father. We see this requirement from your own words.”I,m a hero and I,m writing this to brag”",28-05-2021 11:41,539,708,,

The archeologist is your introspective behavior. In my view that’s a good thing. Both the girls in my view are ways you see romance. They are sequential, and in my view the dream advises that your taste in women will change and that both paths lead to an injury in you. The well scene Id say is premonition. Its the well or reservoir of the collective unconscious... a premonition possibly to you posting on this site. The chunk of ice is the non growing you... meaning you choose the first girl or first version of you, the unfrozen water becomes the second version of you as it is brought to light. That is the more integrated growing version of you. The world is a cold place, but you find warmth in yourself as you become wise or resonate with the light. I use light as a metaphor in the spiritual sense. I don’t think it has anything to do with the actual girl, other than sparking your introspection. I think it has everything to do with how the girl will change through your perspective should you choose to either change or not. Or put another way. You are a lense that might dig more or not. The outcome is the same either way.. something is gained and something is lost. Same principle applies to you. If you wish to grow the previous you will die. Hope that makes sense. Either path you choose... make sure to involve the actual girl in this journey. Its a dream that is loaded with spiritual growth symbols.

My contribution was the furthest off from the ideal, but it everyone else seemed content with the proceedings. Something significant was supposed to happen in the ceremony but a car crash or another kind of emergency outside made everyone focus on that instead. However, while everyone was busying themselves with that I noticed a small, almost imperceptible scratch on my the end of my ring finger (I cant remember which hand). I started to squeeze it and puss started to come out. It wasn't painful, in fact it was pretty relieving to have it come out. It was kind of off-white or greenish initially, but as I kept squeezing it, eventually it turned into red, kind of like clotted blood. It didn't take long before I got all of the hardened stuff out of my finger and I as I did so I had garnered a fair amount of ""eww""s and ""yuck""s and ""doesnt that hurt?"" To which I responded ""not really. My body needs to get rid of it."" Having felt I got it all out I looked up again and everything seemed different. The ceremony was apparently forgotten and no one was focused on it anymore. After a little bit of my time my focus went back to my finger where I started to work at it again.

It's worth mentioning that I always know I'm dreaming and try to ""wake up"" so that I can make him stop chasing me but I'm always unable and he gets too close for comfort so I run away). Anyways, when he leaves, I escape out my apartment balcony by jumping and land safely, feeling guilty for leaving my dog behind. I sprint to catch the bus and when I board it, I begin to question if I am dreaming. I can't think around the fact that the dream took place in my apartment for a moment, but I work around that by considering that the apartment I just saw was unpainted and I recently painted mine, and that I escaped bgy jumping which would be impossible. I suddenly wake up and can't tell if I'm dreaming or really on the bus so I ask the woman in front of me, ""excuse me Bonnie, where is this bus going?"" Because I knew if she answered then I was obviously dreaming since I could call her anything and have her answer. She said something like, ""Oh well, things are going all over the place these days and I can't hardly ever keep track. I just go for the ride."" I woke up and told the bus to stop, which it did and all the passengers froze. Next, I pointed to the ground and wanted for my dog to be there and he appeared and listened when I told the dream that he needed to be a good boy (he lay down and smiled). Next, I closed my eyes, told the bus to go to a lavender field on a beach instead, and when I opened my eyes the bus pulled up near a beautiful beach where I stepped off, smelt the sea air and lay in the field to relax. I haven't had the horrible dream of being sexually chased since.",11-09-2020 02:08,2,10,673246000000000,780839497,"My take on it is the older man represents wisdom I think, and the forced sexual acts and running from it is something along the lines of the refusal to accept some horrible truth , something you are not comfortable with which would be why the unwanted sexual act is used as a symbol. I think this is then symbolized as a cyclic thing that you keep being forced toward something repeatedly over and over but refuse to confront, preferring to intellectually close the door on it. But it doesn't go away, it just comes back again and again. I'm not sure what that would be, but I would think it relates to the donkey/ mule/ ass being led by the soulless zombie chick all dressed up in a very feminine pink dress... Interesting because it shifts from the old masculine man to this image... I'm trying to wrap my head around that...Then steam punk guy, might be around future stuff somehow, tries to make you confront this but you can't bring yourself to do it. You go back to the old cycle rather than learn what you don't want to. The game sequence is an inner conflict you are fighting between the masculine side and feminine side. I'm thinking this could be the thinking vs feeling aspects. Maybe that is why earlier it is running from the male and the female - running from the conflict of the two. Perhaps that is the significance of this fight? You don't want to confront it because of the nerves (ripping out the nervous system)? It also could be implied in the chicks being zombies; ie not thinking pending weight to the feminine feeling aspect in polar opposition to the thinking side? Are you conflicted on what you think vs feel over something? Daniels link to Bluebeard as a mythical symbol could imply that it relates to the engagement, though I am not getting anything else in the dream that would imply that, unless he is a bit of an ass that you have to lead around everywhere hence pink zombie chick; as a part of you that you aren't facing up to...?",28-05-2020 12:08,1200,244,,
3235,100040000000000,"I was smoking a cigarette, walking by a busy and narrow street. This place looks like a favela, although much cleaner and the ambiance was happy and full of energy. Unlike the slums where I used to live where it smells piss and dead rats. It was the first time I have dreamed of such a place. I was about to cross the street when I noticed the people started running out of this man’s way. This guy was riding a scooter. He was wearing a denim cap, green long sleeve shirt, light wash pants and a pair of slippers. On his back was a sheath with a long and heavy machete with blood on it. He also had a gun but I can’t recall if it was a shotgun or a rifle. I felt something very evil and sinister as he went past me. Then I went to this share house, upstairs where I was supposed to be living: talked to my housemates and did some other things I couldn’t recall, but I’m pretty sure those parts were fun that I forgot about the guy in the green shirt. I climbed the staircase and opened the door at the end and there I was on the rooftop smoking another cigarette. This share house was relatively taller than most buildings that I could watch the neighbors through their windows, the street market and the people walking around. It felt very calm. Then this woman busted out of the door - also wearing a green shirt - shaking and crying, begging for help. This woman was bleeding all over and I could see one of her eyes sticking out of her face with a huge open wound on her temple showing her cracked skull. I asked her what happened and she said “he’s here”. Then I remembered the man with a green shirt. Then the mood of that dream turned into something out of a horror movie. The sky turned blood red. The people around were shouting “watch out! Lock your doors!”, warning the others including me. The commotion kept getting closer and closer; the kind of noise you would hear from people screaming in terror. Then I heard loud thuds inside the share house and the footsteps on the staircase. I realized that he was after the woman. I shouted at the neighbors to call the cops. I locked the door on the rooftop from the outside with just a slide lock using a concrete nail as the barrel bolt. That way it could buy us some time at least. I grabbed her and we jumped and ran on the roof of other houses and shacks.",15-09-2020 00:32,0,2,667670000000000,643937657,"This is a dream about your shadow and the Anima plain and simple. The shadow is the part of the psyche that compensates for one-sidedness in the ego. For example if you become too self righteous in some area your shadow becomes darker in compensation. In dreams it shows up for a man as a male ‘other’ or a dark and sinister place. In the case of this dream it is both. The Woman is the Anima. The anima is the relating factor of the psyche and it helps us relate to both our inner world and outer world. It shows up in a man’s dreams or fantasies as a woman or animal. It is usually projected onto a woman since one of its roles is to help in relating to a mate for the continuation of the species which is a vital role. It is usually misinterpreted as an inner woman. It’s not. It’s an aspect of the male psyche that gets projected onto a woman. Now, the interesting part. When we go inward to our collective Unconscious, the first thing we usually encounter is our shadow. Like I said, when the ego becomes too one sided, the shadow activates as a compensatory mechanism to bring the psyche back into homeostasis. While this self regulation is happening, we lose the connection with our relating factor, the Anima (for a woman Animus). When we lose touch with our Anima, when it is clouded over by the shadow, we lose touch with our deeper instinctive self and it’s impulses. This manifests an internal psychological pressure which may come in the form of anxiety or anger. It’s kind of an instinct ‘wounding’. Another interesting thought is the wound on the eye of the Anima. It’s the dreams way of showing you that while the shadow is active, it is not able to perform its task of looking inward or outward to full capacity.",28-05-2020 12:08,547,370,,
3432,1763432242,I was with Dr. Peterson walking through my city. We walked side by side he spoke and I listenened. I felt so overwhelmed that I had the priviledge to spend time with Peterson and walk with him like he is my close friend. He taught me some good 'psyche tricks' and how to spot liars etc. I hadn't had a good dream for a while but this was just so exciting and good.,11-09-2020 13:53,9,4,660806000000000,100001000000000,"Couldn’t help but notice the similarity of the archetype here. In Genesis God walks with Adam in the Garden similar to you and Peterson walking through your city. Both God and Peterson walk with Adam and you through there own respective areas. As God walks with Adam he teaches him to cultivate the garden because God is a Husbandman he teaches him Knowledge (tree of knowledge) and he shows him how to continually regenerate his life (tree of Life) in short God created Adam and Adam enjoyed these walks with God until he sinned. In your case I see Something similar, Peterson has created a following. He walks with you(continually instructs those he created) but here is where it’s different instead of knowledge and imparting of spiritual life suggesting honor and integrity. Instead we see tricks and lies? In the dream we see that Peterson is your “close friend” I wonder if you have created “a Peterson” that will teach you what you want to hear? This idea is not too far fetched since that’s exactly what man has done, they forgot the true God and created their own god and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles. So I see the exchange taking place here,as you walk with this “close friend” in your city/ garden. What is noticeable is that “psyche tricks (mind games) and “how to spot liars” a small round or roundish mark, differing in color or texture from the surface around it. See, notice, or recognize (someone or something) that is difficult to detect or that one is searching for. To spot something is basically to detect it then mark it/ spot it. Again this is exactly what God did with Cain after the murder of Able, he spotted him that is he placed a mark upon him so that others seeing Cain would not harm him for what he did to His brother. The mark of Cain is God's promise to offer Cain divine protection from premature death with the stated purpose of preventing anyone from killing him. It is not known what the mark was, but it is assumed that the mark was visible. So we see that when God spotted the liar he then marked him out for DIVINE PROTECTION until he could devise a way to brim him back to integrity or REDEEM him since he was unable to redeem himself.",28-05-2020 12:10,98,473,,

Peterson here appears as a ‘wise man’ here instructing you with some good psyche ‘tricks’. When I say the ‘Self’ I’m not referring to the ego, but the summation, the totality of the psyche from the persona, to the ego, to the Shadow and Anima and all the other aspects of the collective Unconscious. It would be fitting that the ‘Self’ (Peterson) would be instructing you in ‘tricks’ of the psyche since it is the cumulative knowledge of the whole psyche. Interesting about spotting liars. Many people suspect people of lying sometimes but then go against their instincts and trust the person only to be betrayed. Your ‘Self’ which has the knowledge of millions of years of evolution built into it, can give you access to wisdom that your conscious mind and it’s constructs may not have access too.

I went to the window to see what he was looking at because there was a strange glow coming from outside. I stood beside my Grandfather, who didn’t say a word. Or move for that matter. It was snowing, but the snow was almost shaped like a curved peanut in the shell and it was cascading down, heavily, in a back and forth motion that would resemble a feather floating down. I was a bit anxious about it and I heard my Mother angrily tell me— from somewhere in the background that it was just snow and that I was being ridiculous. I tried telling her that it wasn’t normal, she wouldn’t look. I looked up at the sky and the clouds were huge and heavy and oddly close to the ground.
