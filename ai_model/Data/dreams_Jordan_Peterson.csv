Agree with Rick re relating to the psyche, or maybe sometimes the unconscious unconscious specifically. When I have these dreams the buildings often have an awe inspiring quality, huge, beautiful buildings.

Carl Jung described a dream of his with this same basic theme. In his, he went down multiple levels, and each level the furniture got more and more antique, eventually coming across a couple of skulls laying on the dusty ground of the lowest level. He understood it as relating to the collective unconscious.

I've also had dreams of climbing circular buildings in spiral stair cases, I think also relates to the psyche itself. Jung described the way the psyche spirals, or circumambulate a centre.",07-05-2022 11:18,98,140
88,1667053795.0,"A common theme in my dreams is driving, and has been for years.

I used to have recurring nightmares about driving through mixmasters that were confusing and more like roller coaster tracks than roads, but haven’t had those for a long time.

A very common recurring theme of late is driving large vans, semi trucks, or RVs over very precarious twisty mountain roads in which I’m constantly about to topple off the road. I’ve never driven an RV or very big truck though. The large vehicle driving over precarious roads started maybe a year ago.

Last night I dreamt I was driving my own minivan (which I love and is not hard to drive, it’s my mobile bike garage and changing room) but there was someone else I was traveling with but we were driving in his vehicle, and then I would go get mine (not sure how that was even possible) and bring it to the current location, while on a multi day road trip. He had tried driving it but was very bothered by how cumbersome it seemed to drive and preferred his smaller and more manageable car. When I drove my minivan after driving his car some I also thought it seemed pretty bulky and difficult to maneuver and park.

I’m going through a lot lately and my dreams have become very vivid since I stopped smoking weed six weeks ago after being a multiple times a day smoker for many years. Cannabis suppresses dreams, but I still would have fairly vivid dreams, they’re just super vivid now.",19-03-2022 04:02,2.0,1,988749000000000.0,1721451638.0,"In my experience, vehicles I associate generally with 'my current path in life'.

I've had similar dreams about various large vehicles, buses, lorries shedding part of their load into the road, and of cars blowing up, and vehicles reaching an unpassable/
narrow section ahead of a sharp turn, then stopping. For me, I think* it related to my plan to go part time at work, shed some of my workload.

When I recognise a general theme shared across dreams, I then look for the smaller details that are different across dreams. In one of mine involving a bus my boss randomly cropped up in it, which is wy I think they related to my work life, and plan to go part time. I was also getting the bus to work at the time.

I tend to believe that every little detail in dreams is significant, so I'd suggest picking out some of the smallest odd little details and try and find an interpretation that explains both the general theme, as well as the details, too.

Vivid dreams after stopping smoking weed is really common, they tend to fade or stop being recalled some weeks later. People do say they suppress dreams, and also the fact they inhibit short term memory and probably make us sleep deeper may also mean recalling dreams in lighter, broken sleep more likely.",28-03-2022 11:19,296,257

Right before bed I was writing about my goals and activities. The dream involved me, Elliot, and Dave Chappell flying a helicopter. We were on some sort of mission, and I was becoming skilled at managing the horizontal and vertical aspects of flight. I had accumulated about five hours of flight time, and Dave alluded to a combat kill as well. At one point Dave was going to fly, and he tossed the keys up on the roof by accident. He recovered them without incident. The baby was in the back, secured in a car seat. Our last flight was in a city, and Dave expressed some urgency. I was very cautious and flew very gingerly because there were many power lines around and I didn’t want to become entangled and crash.

Context- I have just started a new job in my field after earning my masters in September. I’m also doing a sleep plan as part of a burnout recovery regimen.

The feeling tone of the dream was adventurous. I was encouraged. Then at the end with the power lines I was worried.",21-02-2022 16:02,1.0,3,974975000000000.0,1134906426.0,"I think it's a wonderfully positive dream.

I was walking through medieval cellars that were continually getting tighter, in one instance I even had to squeeze through. on the floors, there laid a number of turtles, some on their back, some about to fall, and some just lying normally. Their heads were scaly, some reminiscent of a dragon.

When I got out of the cellar I found myself on a town square. It was evening, lights dim with some shadows flying around. Only one shadow was dense and round. It wore a blue and white jacket with a masquerade mask. I provocatively yelled at it ""Hey death!"" It noticed me and started slowly and ominously chasing me.

Suddenly, a girl clad in a celebratory village dress. She said that ""It´s starting"" and took me inside of a room that was connected with the town square. A great iron gate with bars was closed behind me. More girls who had the same dress were inside. Clergymen started a prayer, yet I did not know the words. I felt ashamed, anxious, and the shadow was staring at me hauntingly. Then a dance started, I did not know the moves, I was being pushed around, I even pushed off a glass that broke.

The women did not care, they were happy that I was trying to dance with them.

After the dance, I started picking up the shards and cut myself accidentally. My blood was not dense, and it was watery. After the cut, my father called me and asked me how I was.

Jung would say the turtle is a common symbol of the Self, a turtle on it's back or about to fall might represent a less than ideal state of the Self, one in need of/lacking help. He has also described the turtle as representing the transcendent function, that which unites the opposites.

Jung has also said reptile-like scales - and the dragon - are associated with the sympathetic nervous system. Incidentally, the sypathetic nervous system is what constricts blood vessels, allowing them to move through smaller spaces under pressure, as you were in this dream. I wonder whether your blood taking on a watery quality is somehow also related. You said you woke up cold. vasoconstrictio
n of the blood vessels is what keeps you warm when cold.

Ordinarily, blood is associated with emotion, in Jungian interpretations
.

To me, this dream seems like it might be about integration of the personal Shadow, in order to aid the development of the Self, but given your point about watery blood, crawling along constricted routes, and waking up cold, I wonder whether this dream is simply a response to your physical state at the time of the dream.",28-01-2022 11:20,405,255

There is a very classic interpretation by Jung (one of his own dreams if I remember correctly) where he interpreted a house in a dream as an image if the mind. The basement is the subconscious. Deep beneath the house is the collective unconscious, where dragons and monsters dwell. These are the complexes of the collective unconscious, the things that you need to face in order to mature as a human being. Tod Venn mentions the dragons and Shadow above. The village and traditional clothing also sounds as relating to the collective subconscious. I think Peterson would say that this relates to drives that are collective to us as humans, and sometimes older that Homo Sapiens.

There is a conflict here between the feminine (the women) and a religious and/or patriarchal authority (clergy, your father). There appears to be a situation that is out of your control; the dancing on broken glass, closed gates, you are pushed around and don't know the moves. Maybe some kind of ecstatic feeling of being out of control. Maybe you need to learn to let go? There is also a conflict here; on the one hand you are trying to dance, on the other hand the clergy and your father are disapproving of you. You may want to contemplate this in relation to your relationship to your father. This may either refer to your actual father or be a symbol of a hierarchical way of thinking, especially as relating to religion and spirituality (considering the clergy).

The part about the blood is also interesting, and I would advise you to contemplate it rather that try to give you an answer. My spontaneous associations are that blood is thicker than water, and also the passage in the Gospels where a Roman sticks a spear into the side of the crucified Christ, and both blood and water comes out (a scene which is closely related to baptism and the Mass), but these are my associations, not yours.",28-02-2022 11:20,405,391
179,520001791.0,"Hi guys, I haven't had a nightmare in some time. I can't even remember the last time. This was one of those ones you wake up shaking from and SO glad it was only a dream.
I was somehow involved in a murder. An acquaintance of ours (a big man) had beaten another man to death and a few of my friends and I had sort of egged him on over text message. The whole dream was the police surrounding us all, mostly old school friends, a toxic ex best friend of mine and a toxic ex boyfriend. Also my beloved grandma who has passed, had been involved!
We were all surrounded by the police and about to be interrogated. I knew that if they saw my text messages or diary entries (I had a few journals lying around in a bag and in my hand etc), I was screwed. I was considering deleteting the messages or journal entries but didn't want to act like I was covering anything up.
I was trying desperately to talk discreetly to my friends (with the police around us) to make sure we were on the same page about what we were going to say.
I knew I was facing jail. Maybe 1-6 months. Or maybe none at all, but I was just hoping and praying I wouldn't go to jail.
My main focus was my kids and them thinking I was the worst mum in the world for going to jail. I've already done a few things to disappoint them and I knew this one would just take the cake...
Thoughts? Thanks if you got this far :)",07-02-2022 22:02,2.0,2,966038000000000.0,1721451638.0,"Jung spoke about how the 'strong man', or thug, is the archetypal representation of the first stage of the development of the female's Animus.

The natural tendency for us to repress aspects of our behaviour interests me, and is obviously a function of the unconscious, like not allowing ourselves to be aggressive and let off steam, which can cause us to eventually explode like a pressure cooker etc. I wonder whether the violent behavior of the masculine symbol was so intolerable to you it made you act violently too. I wonder whether this is about the way you judge against the naturally repressed aspects of your own personality which have value, which the unconscious projects onto the masculine symbol here.

Given the thug, this dream may relate to the initial stage of Animus integration, and given that you were involved in the killing of him, may speak to how you judge against and repress what he represented, in yourself. The killing may also imply a transition from the first stage, to the second stage of the development of your Animus. In the second stage the Animus, the symbolically masculine aspect of the female's personality is associated with forward planning, among other things, as you were in this dream.

Here is a very brief post that references Jungs point about the forms the Animus takes on, including the initial stage taking the form of a strong man/thug. It's form changes over time. Next it might appear as an intellectual, professor or similar.

Jungs last book Man & His Symbols speaks about the job of the female in integrating her Animus, and the difficulty in doing so, its reward, and the evolving forms it takes on in females dreams.

Broken Escalator, Indian Store

I am walking around a dilapidated city. It is an urban area. There are bridges here and there, I walk around - supposedly using a map. Not too sure. I end up having navigated myself at a store which contains carpets and other antique looking things. It seems to be an Indian store that sells carpets and furnishings. I go to the end of the store, where the receptionist walks me through, she presents with her hands from the back of the store the view of the whole store into the front. Above me there is a broken escalator which captures my attention, I then look up and notice to my surprise that there are people up there but there is no way to enter the second level of this furnishing store. I then leave the store and walk into a shop that is selling religious photos of Krishna and Radha used for decorating altars.",18-01-2022 15:43,2.0,1,954205000000000.0,1233063635.0,"There's a lot of layers in this dream.

I don’t know what your dream is about, however there are some things that seem to stand out.
I,m going straight to the end part of your dream first, because for me I can see that the Goddess Venus is at the centre of the palace which I understand to be a pagan church.
The Baroche style church that is within this palace are the Roman Catholics way of reaching out to the people at a time to set themselves apart and above other religions with grand architecture, beautifully composed music, great artwork all within this palace of the great Goddess Venus.
Everything is designed to attract to the senses everything is done on a grand and beautiful way but the church is more for show and attraction not a real church of god but a showpiece that lacks what you truly seek?
The pagan church is well known as a harlot church, a prostitute such as was Venus who took on many lovers and also sold herself.
The pagan church is mentioned in the bible rev 18:4
Then I heard another voice calling from heaven, “Come away from her, my people. Do not take part in her sins, or you will be punished with her.
Since Venus is at the centre of the palace in your dream it may be well to,make mention of her.

Venus
Goddess of love, beauty, desire, sex, fertility, prosperity and victory.

A 2nd- or 3rd-century bronze figurine of Venus, in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon[4]
Origins[edit]
Venus has been described as perhaps ""the most original creation of the Roman pantheon"",[5]: 146 and ""an ill-defined and assimilative"" native goddess, combined ""with a strange and exotic Aphrodite"".[b] Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome's official pantheon and the state, and the unofficial, illicit manipulation of divine forces through magic.[5]: 13–64 [7] The ambivalence of her persuasive functions has been perceived in the relationship of the root *wenos- with its Latin derivative venenum ('poison'; from *wenes-no 'love drink' or 'addicting'),[8
] in the sense of ""a charm, magic philtre"".[9]

In myth, Venus-Aphrodite
was born, already in adult form, from the sea foam (Greek αφρός, aphros) produced by the severed genitals of Caelus-Uranus.[
10] Roman theology presents Venus as the yielding, watery female principle, essential to the generation and balance of life. Her male counterparts in the Roman pantheon, Vulcan and Mars, are active and fiery. Venus absorbs and tempers the male essence, uniting the opposites of male and female in mutual affection. She is essentially assimilative and benign, and embraces several otherwise quite disparate functions. She can give military victory, sexual success, good fortune and prosperity. In one context, she is a goddess of prostitutes; in another, she turns the hearts of men and women from sexual vice to virtue.[c]

Prospective brides offered Venus a gift ""before the wedding""; the nature of the gift, and its timing, are unknown. The wedding ceremony itself, and the state of lawful marriage, belonged to Juno - whose mythology allows her only a single marriage, and no divorce from her habitually errant spouse, Jupiter - but Venus and Juno are also likely ""bookends"" for the ceremony; Venus prepares the bride for ""conubial bliss"" and expectations of fertility within lawful marriage. Some Roman sources say that girls who come of age offer their toys to Venus; it is unclear where the offering is made, and others say this gift is to the Lares.[12] In dice-games played with knucklebones, a popular pastime among Romans of all classes, the luckiest, best possible roll was known as ""Venus"".[13]

As we can plainly see that Venus and her palace and the baroche Roman Catholic church’s beautiful music are not the church’s of Christ but the cults of Venus
The church in the palace is a new style of church as mentioned designed to reach out to people with magnificent architecture and paintings and beautiful composed music. Here the attraction is to the senses of beauty and gratification as compared to the church of Christ the cross being the centre piece of his church.
Venus is basically saying come and worship me and gratify yourself to the full as compared to the church of Christ which says deny yourself the lust of the flesh.
Here is the setting of your dream and it’s comparison.

Still don’t know what this dream means to you just noticing things that’s all?
It does seem obvious that for you to have this type of dream or story that you would be heavily connected, in some way?
Some observations… 3 water scoops, 3 coffins and 3 people you, your fiancé and his infant brother?

The description of the water scoops is telling. First of all water in relation to a church belong to Christ.The building is made of people understand fully that water represents cleansing and washing.
Ephes 5:24:27
24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ,

25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;

26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,

27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
Notice the church is subject to Christ!
Notice the water is the word of god that is used for washing our lives
The purpose of washing is that the church will be presented to Christ as holy and beautiful and virtuous.

In your dream we notice the first scoop of water is in “polished wood”?
This is meant to be for the washing of the church as gods word is meditated upon and read daily his spirit makes it clean our conscience making us one with him. The wood represents the natural man who, in the church of Christ will go down into the waters of baptism and the natural man will die but ride again in christ
In the baroque style pagan church this is called holy water is Only for show, this is evident as “polished wood” is the description. Yes the church is highly polished to attract followers but the true meaning is lost in the polish. Religion is highly polished.
The silver scoops in the bible speak of redemption and purification

A SYMBOL OF PURIFICATION

The process of heating silver to burn off the dross and other imperfections is a metaphor used throughout Scripture. God’s Word itself is described in value beyond silver: “The promises of the LORD are pure, like silver refined in a furnace and purified seven times” (Ps 12:6). The purification process was sometimes used as a symbol for the way God tests and refines people: “You have tested us, O God. You have refined us in the same way silver is refined” (Ps 66:10; see also Isa 48:10). A silversmith would have to attentively watch the silver, getting it to just the right heat, in order to purify the metal. God also watches us as he put us through fiery trials, never leaving us for an instant and only allowing the situation to progress to the point where it is helpful for our sanctification.
In the church of Venus the water and silver scoops are just for show however Venus may expect her followers to perform rituals suitable for her?
What’s missing here is the gold of course which represents the golden nature of Jesus.
Peter the disciple and apostle makes mention of silver and gold showing the true meaning of being washed in water and refined by fire.
Acts 3:6

New International Version
Then Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.
Here we can see the true purpose of washing and refining that healing to others comes forth this is not obtained by polishing or showcasing but this comes from the rugged wooden cross in which we are all called to bear. This cross will sometimes cause pain but true healing proceeds from this unpolished cross of Christ.
What’s also missing is the blood.
It’s the blood of christs that offers true redemption.

An attic is usually a place to store things, but what things are stored within this palace and baroque church?
Your dream shows us 3 coffins, one with the infant brother of your fiancé then 2 more coffins as well as you and your fiancé?
It’s almost like you 3 are in spiritual cold storage?
I don’t know? The infant brother dying to make way for the grown man ?
The grown fiancé ready to meet you equally?
The coffin is made of wood it holds/stores the body. Like the wooden water scoop they speak of death and yet the body is in storage in the attic?
It almost seems like this storing in the attic represents hope for a new beginning the 2 silver water wheels and the 2 of you waiting, hoping, trusting in Venus to give you new life?
Biblically speaking each of us takes up his wooden cross and dies daily to the things of the world and as that carnal nature dies the new spiritual man is born anew but in Christ.
2 Corin 5:17
New Living Translation
This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!
As a Christian when we die in the water of baptism we first die then like the coffin we are virtues then like Christ we rise again but in him because he is the one who overcame death that’s why we are baptised in him.
In your dream it seems that all your hope is in Venus? Did Venus overcome death fir you? Or does Venus just want your life for herself?
1 Corin 15:53
53For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. 54When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.” h

55“Where, O death, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?” i
56The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 57But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

This is from her book, 'Sexual Personae':

""Arrow, eye, gun, cinema: the blazing lightbeam of the movie projector is our modern path of Apollonian transcendance. Cinema is the culmination of the obsessive, mechanistic male drive in western culture. The movie projector is an Apollonian straightshooter

Possible adult viewing compare toy teddy bear
While I don’t understand all of this some things stand out?
For me the cinema is a large screen that has the power to bring its movies/ entertainment to life for the viewer.
You seem to understand this concept of the cinema as a mechanism that has the power to breathe life into what ever is fed into the projectors. To me the fact that you have stayed behind is to make use of this mechanism by turning it on yourself. You go there to see for yourself the larger than life screen, it’s intention is for informing and to entertain but somewhere along the line you have realised that by looking into something you can bring it to life just like the toy teddy bear at home on your tv. The toy teddy bear is a comfort to you it’s strength it’s warm fur can be your friend and companion as a toy is your friend howbeit lifeless.

Bears are not mean or malicious; they are very gentle and tolerant animals. Mother bears are affectionate, protective, devoted, strict, sensitive and attentive with their young. Not unlike people, bears can be empathetic, fearful, joyful, playful, social and even altruistic.
Her is what you see in the toy teddy bear perhaps but as you look at it begins to undergo a change something is happening that s bring it to life just from watching it on the tv?
Your toy teddy bear is undergoing a change the monster within his breaking through this once loveable toy.
The tv scene has taught you somehow there is a way to bring things to life except instead of bringing the best out of the lifeless toy the transformation of the toy teddy somehow brings out the monster ?
Perhaps this intrigued you this transformation of the toy teddy it’s your teddy you should be able to control it right?
Looking back at the cinema you understand the same idea that if the tv at home has the power to bring toys to life then how much more power does a larger than life cinema screen have to bring you to life to transform you into much more that you are?
You go to the cinema with the idea of using its mechanism that is its projector and film tapes to film yourself and then project yourself onto the big screen. By filming yourself and projecting yourself onto the cinema screen you attempt to bring out the inner you to bring you to life that is what the cinema screen is designed to do.
However just like the toy bear that is harmless and comforting a monstrous change takes place you find that you are now being chased around this cinema you know you shouldn’t be doing this transformation stuff but you can’t resist. Now that you have released your inner self and bought it to life via the mechanism of the cinema you find that it has released a monster just like the toy bear? It chased you why? Because you have miscalculated that you think you are in control but by circumnavigatin
g natural methods of growth and try to release the inner and more powerful you like the bear seem to turn on yourself and it is no longer your friend no longer a comfort but in breathing life into something that’s not ready it turns on you.
In summary it seems like you are dabbling with the inner self in ways that are not healthy for you, yes you discovered how to bring things to life but even doctor Frankenstein could do that.
The way you go about indulging these transformations
are merely mechanical there is no time for healthy integration no time to slowly grow into maturity just a quick fix and a flirt with nature that turns against you.
Ok here is the correct method of transformation.

Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
Romans 12:2
Notice the mind first needs to be renewed but by your creator not you!
God made you to a pattern in his image he made you in a way that you are meant ti be transformed under his hand not yours not a monster that chases you. That transformation is performed miraculously by the Holy Spirit and the end result will be a beautiful spiritual person not a monster.
Having been transformed you will also receive the power of god that y are craving but that godly power to do good be be content with your life.",28-12-2021 11:22,131,871

Hotel- place where people sleep temporarily but don’t stay

Raptor- instincts, drives, urges that you regard as predatory and frightening- Shadow

You try hiding in bed but it doesn’t work- afraid of savage/
predatory urges that take place in bed

You trying to hide among blankets and stuffed animals- childish patterns and comforts don’t help with uncomfortable feelings like this

Climbing outside of building- “leaving home” because of the urges/feelings

Friend is courageous and upbeat- the unconscious encouraging you to crowdsource this problem? Or maybe an element of your personality is particularly well-suited to this problem and needs more “funding”

Traffic- cars often signify ones life path- stalled car is feeling stuck, someone else driving is feeling out of control, etc trying to lose the raptors in traffic is like hoping the normal ebb and flow of life will help distract from the problem

Men on a food truck- one urge- eating- protecting from another urge, or from negative feelings. Troubled relationship with food as a coping mechanism?

Friend- “take me back there.” Part of you knows good and well that confronting the raptors is the right move, and another part wants to flee from that encounter

Just to clarify, I don't mean you should forgive her or think you really did forgive someone else for the same thing. I'm just taking a punt at what YOU might feel underneath, and if it's off base, no worries, I'm just wrong.

I suspect that because it's a complicated issue, because there's a conflict between her guilt and victimhood, it's just difficult to know whether you should a. be angry with her for her guilt or b. forgive her because she's also another of your ex-husband's victims. I don't know either, but just to reassure you, those conflicting emotions are all normal and valid. IF you have any anger towards yourself, whether for being his victim, for not doing enough to keep the family together (that's a bullshit lie if you ever feel that), for not forgiving her (yet or IF you ever decide to), that anger is also valid in context of how difficult the situation is but also misplaced.

Because you have been mistreated, partly by her, it makes perfect sense that you can't just forgive her casually, just because she's also a victim. It makes sense that you might feel like she's following you and blaming you or acting entitled to forgiveness automatically, because the confusion and hurt follow you.

I would also suggest that you are a forgiving person, if you have a subconscious awareness of forgiving people for certain things, but it isn't as simple as that when you're the victim, particularly of betrayal *(the worst of all sins, if you will).

You couldn't help and don't bare any responsibility for the fact that he was a dishonest, selfish bastard who couldn't keep his pants on or that she fell for things and didn't reject a married man. You weren't not enough. He wasn't enough to meet you where you were and prioritise family, love, and personal sacrifice for long-term gain.

Thoughts only..the 2 hours seem like the 2 women in your dream? One hour is a time, a time is descriptive of a certain time in each woman’s life. The dream now speaks of the time “away” from your ex highlighting what each woman is going through after married life.
The 2 hours being connected are most likely the same woman 2 hours of time on the same clock so to speak.
By looking at how each woman handles the situation we see opposites we see conflict as they finally both meet at the same home town in the same pub which is to say both women are in each other’s lives and now they intersect giving you greater understanding about yourself.
You being the first woman, the wife do what most of us would do after a marriage break up, you go home to your hometown where it’s safe and secure. From there you slowly take time out to relax and slowly start to rebuild your social life with friends at the pub.
The other woman being the mistress that’s what she feels like not truly married to the husband because you are the true wife but now you are not married the mistress is revealed to you. That is the other woman within you. That woman also needs attention.
Notice she follows you to your home town that’s because she has to because it’s her home town as well. She unlike you is a professional dancer, instead of taking things slowly applying social patience she is out to drum up business for herself. While you are at a loss she’s getting paid for it. While you are sort of suffering she is marching forward.
The pub is the apex where you finally meet the other woman, she’s not a mistress in real life she is the other part of you that has become the mistress because you were the wife and she was neglected. Now you are no longer the wife she is set free to find a husband for herself.
Here is your conflict because it’s at the pub where the 2 hours meet and you begin to realise and start to feel for this mistress. You have suffered by your husband but she has suffered also by being relegated to mistress.
The hour of your experience has given you empathy for others and you can understand how she might be feeling having been locked out of the relationship. You now emphasise with her.
At first you are shocked that this woman has followed you to your home town that is the other part of you is free and starting to be exposed to you now but now you begin to understand she has nowhere else to go. Her behaviour being a bit rowdy now begins to find acceptance with you. You really feel sorry for her.
It’s a great story where after time you manage to forgive yourself while at the same time as being angry towards the ex you understand that the other woman was suffering while you were married. While you were married she suffered now that you are not married you are suffering. I see the gradual integration of the 2 women coming together. Now the both of you reconcile your differences being able to fit together and be more accepting of each other. Healing and growth have occurred.",28-11-2021 11:22,308,627

I was a fish, I was lost in the sewers, and I was guided by another fish, I believe. I could hear its voice. It led me trough the dirty water, towards the ocean.

Once we managed to emerge in the ocean, it was great. We swam near the surface.

I felt uneasy. The idea of dying was not so great, after all. I tried to get as far away from the fishermen as possible. I was afraid, because I realized even if I were to die, who can guarantee i will be reborn human, and not a puma, bear or another unfortunate animal?

And then I woke up.

Thank you!",29-11-2021 02:35,3.0,5,925154000000000.0,1759857940.0,"Wow. Very interesting and powerful dream.

I doubt that we can tell you how to interpret it 'correctly', but the one suggestion that I would have is that you might want to start consciously (and subconsciously!
) forming a relationship with a fish as your totem animal or spirit guide.

There are various ways to do that; including making attempts during a light meditative trance to go back into the ocean and talk to the same fish guide.

Or it it's easier for you to work with anthropomorphic
symbolism, you can perhaps try to cultivate a relationship with a sea goddess, perhaps in the archetypal form of a mermaid.

One thing I would not do is just let this slide, or write it off as a one-time oddity.

This is very much a GIFT from your inner spiritual powers, and I would make the most of it.

However, I would not go down the road of fearing reincarnation. There is some good evidence for it.

Cultures and religions that believe in reincarnation traditionally DO believe that humans can reincarnate as other animals -\-\ but only if they are relatively unawakened, and that is what they need on their soul's evolutionary journey.

It's best to regard all that -\-\ karma, dharma, and reincarnation -\-\ as something that is on your side, and working in your favor.

One other thing is that you might want to read up on Carl Jung if you're not familiar with his work; and maybe join a Jungian group online. They also work with dream interpretations
, so then you can get a wider range of feedback.

It does seem very clearly about death and reincarnation itself.

I guess slightly less literal possibilities could include a death & rebirth of some aspect within the context of your current life.

Or, perhaps it might relate to the the Age of Pisces we're currently all living through, which is nearing it's end as we head towards the Age of Aquarius. This could also have associations with religious symbolism relating to Jesus and the symbol of the fish.

I was listening to Alan Watts yesterday, and he mentioned in passing his opinion that Jesus may very well have been a real person who had experiences of what Alan said ""we call cosmic consciousness"",
and that Jesus had claimed that he was God incarnate. In Jungian terms this experience would be a psyche - or ego death. Your dream reminded me of this, and there is an aspect of your dream which I'd say is quite unusual in that your identity had shifted, that you were not ""you"", but a fish. So there are common themes of a revealed surprising nature of identity, death, rebirth, and the fish through both the biblical story and your dream.

Interesting that you had not died and become a fish, at least within this dream, but were already a fish and were contemplating dying and being reborn as a human again, knowing that you were once human before.

The waters clearing as you got further and further away from the human domain is also interesting. Swimming near the surface might be related to your then state of consciousness as you dreamed.",28-11-2021 11:22,247,306

The fish that guides you is the Holy Spirit himself or the holy spirit speaking through a friend who knows that you need to get out of the sewers.
“I believe” an act of faith
“I believe I can hear his voice”
Not everyone can hear the voice of god or understand.

John 10:27
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

When we continually live in the sewer we become accustomed to it but we are told not to confirm to it.
Romans 12:2
Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
Your fish leads you through the unclean waters to the ocean and as you follow the voice of god the water becomes clearer and cleaner.
“I wanted to go back to the human world’
And her we see the reason for your dream it is god who is jealous over you and cares for you admonishing you not to go back to the unclean sewer.
Don’t be like lots wife who looked back.
You want to enjoy human life again just as when the slaves left Egypt to go to the promised land they wanted to go back to Egypt but in your dream you seem to get past this as you “near the surface”
The other fish instructs you to allow yourself to be caught by the fishermen and you will be reborn again.
This is obviously talking about the disciples who are gods fishermen of lost souls who have been instructed to go into all the world and save men from the sewer.

Matthew 4:19 ►
“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”

Jesus called out to them, “Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!”

And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”

“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”
So here we can see a hint of what god wants you to do,that is he will teach you how to catch other fish and lead them into the clean teachings of new life

You are concerned about dying but not so because the idea is that you die to the old world and become alive in the new world so you must be born again.

You Must Be Born Again
3 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named (A)Nicodemus, (B)a ruler of the Jews. 2 This man came to Jesus[a] (C)by night and said to him, (D)“Rabbi, (E)we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do (F)unless God is with him.” 3 Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is (G)born (H)again[b] he cannot (I)see the kingdom of God.” 4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?” 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born (J)of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. 6 (K)That which is born of the flesh is (L)flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.[c] 7 (M)Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You[d] must be born (N)again.’ 8 (O)The wind[e] blows (P)where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”

Had a dream where I received the stigmata in a small middle eastern town to “prove” that I was hardcore on Easter. My hands were wounded and my right wrist was broken.

Elon probably represents your ability to create new things and innovative. You're excited because you hope that this will lead to the tool you need to get what you want out of life. I'm wondering why you'd want to build a fish trap, instead of a fishing rod. Maybe you want a quick and passive solution, but Elon suspects that this is going to take more time and patience, like fishing with a rod.

For the second dream, I'd say you're planning for a Christ-like resurrection after this tragedy. Part of you wants to feel all the suffering to prove you are worthy of rebirth but you're having doubts because openly suffering will have negative consequences on the people close to you.

Take what you will from that. Perhaps you can think of how the symbolism relates specifically to your relationship with your grandmother, and come up with different interpretations

I get a bit of sleep paralysis here and there too or whatever you call seeing one part of your room become part of a dream.

And so.
Onto the dream.
I'm drifting in and out of dream paralysis and all of a sudden I'm about to be attacked, in my bed by a shadowy figure who turns out to be my mum. She's got a knife and swings at my left shoulder, leaving it kind of wedged in there (not very deep but I didnt know straight away) I do the usual 'kill the attacker' routine which is usually just me throwing them onto the ground angrily and repeatedly to get them to stop being a cunt to me. Except this time I'm not only angry and frustrated but I actually felt a bit threatened there since this is the first time I've ACTUALLY been stabbed and attacked in the place I always fall back to as a safe and won't ever reject or leave me place: my bed.
So I get up and she's got another knife ready. I shover her to the floor and tell her to stop but she's about to get up again. I pick up a smaller version of this weird hexagonal iron hook (like an S shape you use to hang things) and an iron hexagonal straight bar and start whacking her.
It's pretty intense, she's huddled on the floor and before long I stop and shout at her to just stop. She doesn't tho, I don't think she can see me or hear me (and yet apparently she's still capable of killing me) so I have to kill her. I stab her in the heart (no blood comes out it aint like that) and then she says I love you in the most genuine and sincere way I've ever heard and I automatically say it back (she never heard her mum say ily so she tries to give me what she didnt have but idk it never hit like how it hit in that dream, and I usually say it back begrudgingly in real life) but then that moment is ripped from me when she goes crazy mode and says ""... only if you call me 'something'bunny""
So yeah I'm quite concerned as to what this all means.
I'm asian for reference and Oedipal mothers, infantilization gaslighting, emotional neglect, low self worth and responsibility avoidance amongst a plethora of others are culturally accepted.
At one level or other I feel like anyone else in a similar situation know this to be true but have never explored their past critically enough to be able to know what an Oedipal mother is.

I'll do my best and be brave I suppose but its often the case that thats not good enough because I have nothing to show for it. Don't get me wrong it hasnt all been bad amd there have been great steps ib the right direction but I know FOR A FACT that I'm acting out a malevolent tragedy and well solving that is TOP PRIORITY as far as I'm concerned.

And this is the sort of thing, people always say ""Oh you should talk to people. No man is an island. Everyone needs to be heard and have their feelings validated. If you need help ask, don't bottle it up, just ask"" so here I am asking but is it socially appropriate? Hell no.

Your dream talks about you and your younger brother Bob. Is it possible that the cub that approaches you is represents your brother? Bob was in a prison, an enclosed prison, could it be that in some way you are also in a prison trapped by your old memories?Bob may have broken the law but you are affected by that since a different type of prison is created for you? In your prison “there are no walls or ceilings”
Perhaps you need rest for your soul but you need to work to gather the material “grasses to rest on and a pillow to rest your head then a blanket to keep the cold away,
The picture here is that you are working at it to provide yourself with what you need to get by without your brother?
As you toil the little cub “emerges” he approaches you and “licks your left hand”
This licking of the hand is a way of showing affection to you but more importantly he is showing you acceptance as a family member. You need him now and he emerges. The social bond is also setting up a family bond in case of any potential threat that may arise. The acceptance from your brother the cub also extends to his and your mother.
The mother enters by “saunters through the remnants of the living room” the depressing memories of the past will be put to rest now as she makes her entrance with strength and majesty, she’s not afraid and will now replace the hurt with a new strength and social order? As part of her family you will be loved and protected and recognised as her cub. when she comes along she sniffs your belly as a mother accepts and nudges you and finally lays over you in an act of love and full acceptance and protection and in doing so you are reunited with your brother again.",28-11-2021 11:24,311,355

In the dream, I was at home in my living room. Interior of the room was so bright that I remember looking at the curtains and the walls but only when I woke up I could understand that I was at home. You could barely see anything.

I don't know when it started and how long it lasted, but a voice, a shout came from the unknown. Then a disembodied, disfigured white spirit appeared. He kept claiming that he was a holy being, a prophet, or a God. He spoke very well. The things he said were very nice and peaceful but it felt so bad for some reason, I just wanted to get away from him. It was so scary.

After a while, this time I heard a voice inside my own head.

I had paranormal dreams from age 16 on. However in my early 20’s they got increasingly worse, the entities got closer to me and began touching me, getting right in my face, pulling me off the bed, they stayed for longer. I always got them to leave by training myself to say the name of Jesus in my dream. These have been the ONLY dreams I’ve been able to train myself to make choices in. Finally I had enough of being afraid to fall asleep and posted a status asking if anyone could help. My pastor friend asked to see me and go for a walk. We worked through some personal stuff that day and I never looked back. Part of what she asked is I get rid of any witchcraft related items in my home that I may have accidentally accumulated. I haven’t had a single sleep paralysis since then.

It seems to me that your dream is a very real testimony of good vs. evil. We are wired to know good when it comes, your intuition knew what was good and true. I think that’s the best take away (without getting into ‘religion’ ) trust your intuition and inner voice.",28-10-2021 11:24,269,256

In Colossians 2:18, Paul warns his readers, ""Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize"" (NIV emphasis mine). Of course, that it is in the genitive case means that we can take in two ways. Either it refers to worship directed to angels or worship done by angels.

I was recently in hospital and still recovering.
“I found myself”
It seems you have been on some sort of journey where perhaps you may have been a little lost in life? But now it’s here in the hospital room where you receive the care and recover. The recovery consisting of revelation about yourself.
You say you don’t know how you got there or why you are there? I had a dream once where I was all but dead and buried underground in a maze of warrens etc.
Then an ambulance turns up with 3 hospital attendants, 2 bearing a stretcher and one leading the way. They sort of made their way to where I was buried in the Warren, rescued me, carried me out on the stretcher , placed me in the ambulance and took me to hospital. For me the hospital staff were angels of god who came to rescue me from my life situation. For me the hospital I was taken too was church where I was well cared for and recovered.
Sometimes we don’t understand what happens , how we are cared for but it happens.

In your dream you also find yourself in hospital, a place to be cared for a place to recover. We notice your situation is “pleasant” you are at ease and relaxed, also “sunny” suggesting your outlook on life is good and the atmosphere of the sun is healing. You are not scared, “calm and fully ok with the situation and almost content” so in fact your hospital what’re ever it represents to you is a great place for you in your life right now.

I think this is the 3rd time you have found yourself?
The Murrow maybe the mirror to your soul I’m not sure but here’s a biblical quote if it helps,

James 1:22-25
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.

The mirror is used to look at yourself
Possibly reconciling your life, having much more now earthly and heavenly?
You have”a quiet contentment now”

I don’t know what the skin hanging to the right side means for you.
You are curious as you look into the mirror. As in the biblical sense the scriptures provide a mirror to see how much we’ve grown to see how much we’ve changed..

1 Corinthians 13:12
For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
We start of as children, immature then we grow spiritually and we measure that growth by looking into the perfect law of liberty.
You are looking into the mirror you see changes, reconciling, healing etc
You were “under the impression that you had been through some kind of brain surgery” however this is a healing adjustment taking place for you.
Again you see the 2 opposites the skin hanging on the right side and the hurting on the left side. I don’t know how to interpret this for you except that it seems obvious that it seem a spiritual balancing is taking place for you?

Again we see 2 pieces” holding your world together?
What are they I don’t know?
“Long beige spongy material” holding your world together?
Spongy material is absorbent which means it has the capacity to soak up, possibly hurt or pain or whatever it is in your life that needs to be soaked up?
We can see the hurt in the left side, pain, inflammation?
Your miraculous experience of giving up drinking would require spongy material which might be a teaching or learning about yourself to enable you to soak up damage or pain?
You say you were “dissocosiation
” of killing yourself but that’s not happening now in fact the opposite is happening, life is good you are content.
The 2 long spongy pieces of long material may be the 2 relationships you had that were good these relationships may have acted as bandages in your spiritual operation?",28-10-2021 11:24,556,554

""The individual bison, for example, is a spiritual psychic symbol; he is in a sense the ""father of the bison,"" the idea of the bison, the ""bison as such,"" and this is why he is an object of ritual.

The Bison is a beautiful majestic animal, at one stage almost extinct and in your dream presents as one of a kind almost?
Your Bison is clearly out of its natural habitat compared the young woman who seems more savy. The Bison’s world has been turned upside down and it’s legs tied up so that it cannot walk in its natural way. In fact your Bison is suspended between the 2 different worlds. One world being its natural territory where she is Queen the other being perhaps social Enviroment where the other woman is in charge ?
At first glance it’s almost a scene where the Animal is corralled in ready for slaughter. We see the leg ropes we see the metallic device which in a slaughter house is what’s known as a bolt gun. This is a metal device where the bolt protrudes into the animals head through the skull and then into the brains. That is what normally happens.
But in your dream there seems to be a different picture, similar but different?
The Bison is being abused by a group of people primarily by a young woman. But in this case the dream goes one step further in that the girl is taking advantage of this situation to simply prove to the “group” that she is as tough as they are but at the expense if the Bison.
The Bison is out of its normal territory and subject to the others within the group because it is been overpowered by them?
The Bison is on the line,suspended online by the ropes. If the Bison is online then we may understand the torture to be coming from the online group? The public display of ridicule is indeed torture to the Bison who is completely out of its depth and now helpless and unable to defend itself?

You don’t agree with any of it and decide to skip past hoping to avoid it.
The word “skip” is interesting in that it alludes to a skipping rope ?
Is it possible that what started out as a game of fun skipping the the the same rope kept the bison tied up in mid air thereby tiring it out mentally and physically exhausting it?
BRITISH..
jump over a rope which is held at both ends by oneself or two other people and turned repeatedly over the head and under the feet, as a game or for exercise.
""training was centred on running and skipping""
The skipping rope alludes to a game being played out?
When you skip past its possibly because you realise it’s no longer a game and decide not to be a part of it. You tried to get past it all but could not escape the final outcome landing at the final scene.
The word “landing” is in sync with “skipping” in that as you leave the skipping rope game you unfortunately land at the end of the game?
Let’s look at the “metallic device again”
Metal;
1.solid material which is typically hard, shiny, malleable, fusible, and ductile, with good electrical and thermal conductivity (e.g. iron, gold, silver, and aluminium, and alloys such as steel).
""an adjustable pole made of metal""

We can see this metal device can transfer electricity as well hard and shiny.
A mobile pbone, perhaps can be used to inflict the same damage as the bolt gun as it has the capacity for information to enter the head etc
As an onlooker and witness you are horrified at what is occuring within the group. You tried to put it out of your head by skipping out.
Let’s look at the word Bison again.
Some slang meanings..
A woman who steals someone else’s bf
A video game street fighter
A wild ox
A fat woman

Some noticeable points between the 2 ..
I’m seeing the Bison as a woman (I’m just taking a guess)
Now we have 2 women, very different women to draw comparisons from.
The first woman, the Bison a huge tough but regal and majestic animal, huge but beautiful to behold therefore attractive, to the young men?
The second woman is the opposite not necessarily cruel but trying to be cruel exceptionally cruel for a reason?
It seems that the first woman has already made a good impression on the men just by being who she is larger than life and majestic she is exceptional and has natural beauty almost one of a kind and well sought after.
The second woman cannot compete with the beauty of the majestic Bison however she does try to compete in the area of toughness.
The 2 women are both tough each in their own way.
The first woman has a natural toughness but is not cruel.
The second woman is tough but lacks the inner beauty.
The second woman becomes jealous of the first woman. She wants the men to see that she also is tough just like the Bison.
This is where the error becomes apparent in the second woman when she acts out of jealousy it causes her to be cruel the exact opposite of the majestic Bison.
The first woman is more at home and in balance with nature.
The second woman is more tech savy she knows how to tie up a natural tough wild animal with rules (ropes) then turning her life upside down.
The 2 women come from different worlds
The second woman displays some sort of power over the first woman in that she has the power to be able to tie the first woman up and even get her suspended by the line (online rules) this behaviour is unkind.
Perhaps the second woman thinks that because she has the power to suspend the other woman that it’s ok? Sometimes an administrator needs to make “tough decisions” to suspend people from unruly behaviour however in this case we see the second woman trying to show others (the men) that her choices are tough choices.
The second woman has suspended the first woman unfairly out of jealousy to impress the men?
Are these 2 women different aspects of the same woman or different women altogether, I don’t know?",28-08-2021 11:24,145,456
382,100006000000000.0,"I had a dream I was trying to cross a river of sorts, except as I went one way, all of a sudden a crocodile appeared. Panicked, I went in the other direction only to find more crocodiles circling. Fuck this shit I’m out, I thought to myself, so I yeeted myself onto this yellow-green log (it was high ground compared to where the crocs were) but out of nowhere the log turned into the biggest croc of them all and had red eyes. I remember thinking and feeling like there was nothing I could do at that point.

Now I don’t know much but I do know a crocodile is a threat and indicates danger at the lowest resolution. What sort of threat or danger or what it means to be surrounded with the only escape being the biggest threat of them all I can’t say for sure but I do know it’s got something to do with what I choose to do when I feel threatened in real life and perhaps I need to do things different.",04-09-2021 00:31,0.0,1,874051000000000.0,1721451638.0,"Is the ideal way actually a threat, or is the threat actually the ideal way, nonetheless? It reminds me a little of the Joseph Campbell / Jordan Peterson point of 'the gold you seek is to be found in the place you least want to look'.

The crossing the river motif has an ancient transcendent symbolism. Apparently in the East it is a common near death experience, like the tunnel of light in the West.

In the dream the croc has two sides, two natures, oppositely related, the ideal way and the dangerous way.

If it represents an aspect of you, the creature is also ancient, primal and comes up from below the waters depths, perhaps the unconscious, I see this as potentially all relating to the way of making the contents of the deep unconscious, conscious. A wise path with real dangers, perhaps no path is without dangers.

Also, sometimes it seems to be nighttime, when it's just that you're weary and not with the right company and rest. When you get the right company and rest, it feels more like daytime, because we have more energy, whether it is or isn't literally. I'd say make sure your mom knows you appreciate her too.

A saying comes to mind, ""Don't grow weary in doing well, because in due time, you will reap a harvest."" Never underestimate planting, no matter how long that season lasts. Keep doing as well as you know in every worthwhile endeavour, and it is actually impossible for that not to pay off.

You have an office in a shopping mall, it’s obviously a business, however you need to know something?
You guys in the dream have been successfully promoting your entertainment Busines but thinks have changed to affect your business now you need to know something? How to adapt to change?
The office girl at the front desk obviously you is getting frustrated since she’s used to doing things a certain way but now that’s changed.
The man st the desk out back is creative he’ll figure out a solution you will get the idea and then finally convey it to the girl at the front desk.
Here’s what I think (which is always going to be wrong) the entertainment industry capitalises on people going out to the movies then after a certain time it is released as a home movie. That time sequence has been getting less and less before it is quickly released in shorter periods of time. This part of revenue making is the after revenue from the movie attendance. Now things are changing again since people due to lock downs are at home more than ever there is a skew now towards home video games happening that make up for the lack of human contact and first hand socialisation this is becoming a serious form of entertainment where home video tracks people at home because they can’t get that interaction at home.
Will smith is teaching you, he is playing with the idea of this new form of entertainment which is not only entertainment but replaced human contact therefore it is worth considering. Somewhere in your life this is what you need to know! When you figure it all out explain it to the lady at the front desk and keep going.

421,545227726.0,"Let me start by saying I have been in this group for a long time and you all seem so much more intelligent than myself in this area of dream interpretation. I’m seeking advice on repetitive dreams.

It’s a very common thing: I am always dreaming that my boyfriend is cheating on me. Twice a week at least, and he is usually behaving way out of character in these dreams. air: flirtatious, doesn’t care about my feelings, comes across arrogant which is not him at all.

Background: I was divorced in 2017 due to finding out my husband had two affairs (that I know of, but there were likely more) my now ex-husband has been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and I went through six months of therapy after our separation left myself and my two kids abandoned (though he is not their biological father)

A year went by and I met my current boyfriend. We dated for a year and then we moved in together, and I quit my job because I moved two hours away to live with him in our hometown. Shortly after I got pregnant and I was seeking work throughout the first 3 months but now I am showing and it is unlikely I will ever get hired just to leave soon, so I have enrolled in University to get my B of A in Psych and then I want to go for my Masters. School starts February.

I am on a waiting list to see a therapist that was recommended to me by my last therapist.

If I had to summarize, I might say that these dreams are likely happening so frequently because I am feeling vulnerable. Allowing a man into our lives again, not working while he makes all the money (makes me feel incompetent, but there is not much I can do about it right now, mind you he does not and will not ever pay my personal bills but he does pay the household bills aside from groceries which I always try to pay for but the odd time he sends me $ for them and it is auto deposited..) going to school is a big step and also makes me feel vulnerable because I will not be able to jump into a career type job again for quite sometime. Being pregnant is also a vulnerable time for a woman in general with body changes and hormone fluctuations, and it’s all happening at once while his life seems to be always ‘light and airy’ so to speak. I think I am feeling inferior, and it is bringing up a lot of triggering emotions from my last relationship, because in my dreams my current partners persona is often mirroring my ex-husband’s persona.

Any advice on how to fix this, and get the dreams to stop?",04-12-2020 17:29,4.0,7,720668000000000.0,100005000000000.0,"I see you have done a lot of thinking on this and it seems to me you have more of a grasp on your thoughts and emotions than you are giving yourself credit for. I think due to your ex-husband repeatedly cheating on you, you have developed some deep fear of abandonment and perhaps even to a traumatic level.

As far as advice goes, talk more about this. Talk with your boyfriend, your family, your friends, and a therapist. Talk to anyone you trust. Confronting these emotions is important to bringing them out of your subconscious and out of your dreams. This will be a challenging and long process.

It’s a very common thing: I am always dreaming that my boyfriend is cheating on me. Twice a week at least, and he is usually behaving way out of character in these dreams. air: flirtatious, doesn’t care about my feelings, comes across arrogant which is not him at all.

Background: I was divorced in 2017 due to finding out my husband had two affairs (that I know of, but there were likely more) my now ex-husband has been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and I went through six months of therapy after our separation left myself and my two kids abandoned (though he is not their biological father)

A year went by and I met my current boyfriend. We dated for a year and then we moved in together, and I quit my job because I moved two hours away to live with him in our hometown. Shortly after I got pregnant and I was seeking work throughout the first 3 months but now I am showing and it is unlikely I will ever get hired just to leave soon, so I have enrolled in University to get my B of A in Psych and then I want to go for my Masters. School starts February.

I am on a waiting list to see a therapist that was recommended to me by my last therapist.

If I had to summarize, I might say that these dreams are likely happening so frequently because I am feeling vulnerable. Allowing a man into our lives again, not working while he makes all the money (makes me feel incompetent, but there is not much I can do about it right now, mind you he does not and will not ever pay my personal bills but he does pay the household bills aside from groceries which I always try to pay for but the odd time he sends me $ for them and it is auto deposited..) going to school is a big step and also makes me feel vulnerable because I will not be able to jump into a career type job again for quite sometime. Being pregnant is also a vulnerable time for a woman in general with body changes and hormone fluctuations, and it’s all happening at once while his life seems to be always ‘light and airy’ so to speak. I think I am feeling inferior, and it is bringing up a lot of triggering emotions from my last relationship, because in my dreams my current partners persona is often mirroring my ex-husband’s persona.

The dream..

The sense of place has a strange feel to it despite the mundane descriptions. I'm in a city, I experience being aboard something like a stationary train or tram, I'm lacking a requirement to travel back on the train, I think I wish to buy a piece of cake before my return journey for some reason, but I'm trying to fish out my payment card and ID card and making other passengers wait, I see my bags on the floor unzipped, my belongings bulging out of them in an unorganized fashion as I fish around on my person for my cards, I feel the passengers impatience with me.

Then I'm standing in something approximating a shopping mall, apparently attempting a different route of travel, standing in front of a phone with old fashioned handset in my hand like those of old phone boxes. I lift up the handset a couple of times, the unusual looking digital screen flickers slightly but fails to spring to life, I lift it a third time and the phone and display then connects successfully. I speak in a slightly shakey voice, stating that I wish to attain something, perhaps this cake I'm after by relaying my card details, to then travel back by alternative means, perhaps by car, and the natural sounding voice I recognize as artificial intelligence identifies by the sound of my voice that I am somehow unfit, as though drunk and intending to drive, only not that, and manages to deduce I'm breaching some rule in what I am asking, recognizing I must be traveling back by a method I'm unfit to do in this circumstance, based upon my request.

I'm then elsewhere walking on some dim grey street, having traveled another different route, I see a person walking in front of me, I recognize them as a second instance of an identical person I've just seen at the opposite end of the road I'm walking down, beyond them I see an oddly distinct looking vehicle drive around the corner of a road, at that moment another identical vehicle drives around the same corner in the opposite direction.

Then I find myself at a different scene, looking at a damaged, blackened decrepit shell of a helicopter leaning towards the edge of a small muddy pit of water beside it. I pan my head right and there is a small glass cubicle, like the glass cockpit of a crane or digger, with a man sat inside it. Beside him is a cake, he asks me what size slice I'd like, I gesture with my finger and thumb the thickness, but my hand is shakey, I worry this looks suspect somehow, I hold my hand with my other hand to steady it, struggling to indicate a sufficient thickness of slice. He serves me a slice of cake within two slices of bread, like a sandwich with some salad in it also. A bit odd, I thought. I took a bite, I sense the cool temperature of the salad.

I ask the person that served me the cake 'what month were you born in?' as if to inquire his relatedness to me, as one might enquire to infer anothers zodiac sign. He says 'I was born in such-and-such a year', (I forget the actual year) clearly failing to understand the concept of a month, answering like a somewhat poorly programmed artificial intelligence humanoid. Then I'm in a car with this person and also my dad, setting off somewhere. My dad begins speaking, addressing this misunderstanding, he says ""this is sometimes the case when people suffering with dementia..."" - and I tell him to drop the subject, knowing this person is some form of artificial intelligence humanoid that may be irritated, or alerted to something being amiss.

So... yeah.

The 2 identical persons/people and 2 identical cars both traveling in opposite directions was perhaps the most intriguing bit for me. And the 2 interactions with AI like beings.

The “cake”you desire seems to place you at odds with all that is normal and regulatory in your life?

it looks like you are not fitting in as well as you should?
Let’s look..
Despite your description of the city being mundane, another word for normal but boring, there is really nothing out of place except You feel “strange” in the city, strange in a normal place?

strange
1.unusual or surprising; difficult to understand or explain.
2. .
not previously visited, seen, or encountered; unfamiliar or alien.
""she was lost in a strange country""

“I experience being on a stationary tram or train”
Trams and trains are meant for commuting in city’s this is normal and people are wanting to commute, they have jobs they have reasons to commute back and forth.
Your tram is stationary and “you lack requirement to travel back?
Because you think you don’t have a reason to commute you are stopped / stationary because you are not properly prepared to travel eg your ID and financials the other passengers in your tram are becoming “impatient” with you?
“I’m trying to fish out my payment card and ID card making other passengers wait?
Other passengers on your tram are wanting to take the same trip back and forth in and out of the city but you seem half hearted you are not properly prepared, you have everything you need but your mind is on the “peice of cake”
The passengers have a good reason to travel back and forth each day but a good reason eludes you and this city is strange to your present mindset your’re not into it? The passengers respect your place in the tram but when it begins to affect them they become impatient since they know the importance of their daily routine they are now starting to fret.
“I’m trying to fish out my payment card and my ID card? 2 cards, one that supports you and one that proves your identity. You have them but they are not readily accessible? Both ore disorganised. You need to look for your financials it is there but you lose time trying to find it. Same with your identity card it’s all there but again you loose time trying to find your identity card.
“I see my belongings in my bags on the floor unzipped your belongings bulging out of them in an unorganised way.
Unzipped is also a slang term that sort of means to reveal all.
This description is how you live. Living out of your bags as compared to someone living in a permanent residence who has a proper place to store all there belongings. This style of living is as you say “unorganised”",28-08-2021 11:26,963,524

The cake!
“I’m lacking a requirement” you can’t see a good reason to take the same journey the other passengers are committed to?
This causes you to think about the “cake”
“I think I wish to buy a piece of cake before my return journey for some reason” rather than concentrating on taking this journey you seem to be more hanging out for some cake?
What is the reason you need this cake to make the journey?
It seems like this cake will embolden you, empower you to make the same journey as the you think you can’t make the trip unless you first take the cake?
So what is the cake that you need more than the journey?
Different meanings for cake..
*A sweet cake as in food?
*A sexual meaning?
* Cake as in drugs as in a slice of some sort of drugs, a peice?
Perhaps your dream at this point is showing you that commitment is empowering and overcoming compared to lack of commitment which has the opposite effect?
I think your dream is showing you that you will surely succeed as long as you take the journey wholehearted, this is correct because your dream is leading you to do it therefore your dream has your best interests at heart and is showing how you can do it not if you should do it.",28-08-2021 11:26,963,263

21 as others have mentioned does seem significant.
I see 21 as a name or description of you. Concerning the use of a number in reference to a name I quickly think of James Bond 007
Or the series “get smart” I think their numbers were 99 and 86. Some times the lady 86 would refer to 99 as Max. But when it was more serious she changed to his number, 99 same as James Bond, he was called James by his female counterparts but 007 referred to his special self.
In a similar way your dream is referring to you as 21. To you 21 is significant and also represents a time of growing in your life.
Now that you’re 30 you look back at yourself as 21 and realise that time could have been better and needed to be changed, in real life you do set out to change from 21 to 30. Your dream conveys this to you as stopping that life and bringing it all to an end “I dreamt that I was about to be arrested and convicted” Normally after growing through to adult hood we would move on to the next stage of our life but in your case 21 needs to go before you can move on. For this to happen you need to be arrested that is in some way taken in to custody.. pulled up in some way and then having been pulled up then convicted about 21 and what it means to you. Once you’ve been “convicted” in your heart you can get on with it to a new start in life. You sort of know you need to do something because you say to yourself “I may have been getting ready to turn myself in” so there is thought and preparation involved about what you see as 21. You don’t really want to kill 21 because that’s who you are and neither does your mother. However you realise that you need to kill 21 because now you have a conviction in your heart that 21 needs to go so that you don’t need to be in this position at 30. You say you were in a position of “unintentionall
y” killing 21 people. Perhaps you were happy to continue your life as 21 until you were arrested and convicted in your heart that 21 needs to die/go.
This is very similar to the language of God, because that’s exactly what the holy spiritual does he arrests us that is stop us from continuing on in a harmful way then having stopped us then works in our heart to convict us that we are wrong, look..
Acts 3:37
When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”

Here we see that people have been convicted in there heart and are now ready to make big changes in their life.

The death of 21 is also significant in that when our old life dies it is really only the outer shell that peels away allowing the precious seed inside to grow. Look..
John 12:24
Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.

Interesting because we see that if we continue living our life as the outer shell it is alone and cannot truly reproduce. But when the old life dies then the true seed the new life begins. This new life will reproduce spiritually and other.
So 21 years is a time in your life, a moment a time of preparation. It’s a normal and natural to shed the outer shell at around that time. But since your life may have been abnormal you needed desperately to be convicted in your heart for the natural process to take place.",28-07-2021 11:27,296,732

You are so convicted in your heart about the changes you need to make that you now feel the weight of guilt about how you lived in 21 your conviction is so great that it causes you to be serious about it and with this seriousness genuine sorrow, look..

2 Corinthians 7:10
10 Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation(A) and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.

Godly sorrow or godly conviction works properly.

Worldly sorrow does not set in motion the beginning of the new life.

21 is the culmination of 21 seperate years. These 21 seperate years are 21 shades of the total sum of you.
For you to begin a new life you first had to deal with your old life all 21 years of it that’s the sum total of 21 this every aspect of your lives as it were.
You have as it seems been thorough “I can’t believe I killed 21 people” “ don’t you think I should go in for negligence or something”?
In wiping the slate clean you have learned through taking responsibility that there is accountability that comes with that although your mother wants to save you from that however you continue saying “your mistake deserves to be punished”

Look at the genuine remorse you take responsibility which is the requirement for a new spiritual beginning.
You know in your heart that you need to change. And when you get the conviction to change you still feel like 21 in that 21 only knows right and wrong. Wrong brings guilt and shame and punishment to 21 “don’t you think I should pay” this is your genuine remorse speaking however since you are still a babe in this new life you haven’t yet understood that genuine remorse has severed you from your past and in that separation you have become separation from punishment because 21 is dead now there can be no more punishment to the dead. when 21 has passed away so to did her ideals of right and wrong which say wrong must be punished. But your new life of 30 does not say that at all because the new life is loving and kind to oneself and forgives oneself which you at this stage of growth have not properly understood yet. Look ..
2 Corinthians 13
4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known

13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.

Because your sorrow is genuine you have entered this new-part of life now this new part is filled with LOVE the old Jess 21 did not have enough LOVE to nurture her towards new growth therefore it was time to go otherwise the seed of life within would never have sprouted.
LOVE never fails wooow!
To an extent your life in 21 failed or dimply comes to an end. you never knew TRUE LOVE now you are learning about this new life that TRUE LOVE NEVER FAILS
In your new life there is no punishment! Only guidance and care. True rebirth must require Forgiveness to grow therefore you should accept forgiveness if you don’t you’ll be resurrecting the life of 21 which as we know does not forgive but only seeks punishment?
Life after 21 loves oneself by accepting all the wonderfull things that life freely gives you at no cost to you. It’s a gift!",28-07-2021 11:27,296,744
508,1721451638.0,"This one got me thinking.

I work from home currently, started early and at the end of the day, slightly before I should have finished work, I feel asleep for a short while. Bad skills, I know.

A recall fragment of the end of a dream, standing in my childhood kitchen, with my mum, maybe also my older sister, them claiming that I basically owe someone parts of a clock that I've yet to give back. I said I didn't know anything about a clock, or having parts of someone else's clock, I felt they were frustrated at me, and since they wouldn't elaborate what parts, of what clock, or whose, it also lightly irritated me, too. Then I woke up.

Now at a guess I'd say this was a prompt to wake up, and I then did, and it's meaning may perhaps likely refer to owing / stealing time from my employer, or perhaps even myself, and being mindful of time passing and needing to wake the hell up.

Aside from the mundane meaning, which I'm pretty confident about, I just thought it was interesting that even though there was verbal language and speaking, and a clear reference to a clock, and that the dream itself had a narrative structure that played out over time, that the reference to time passing was still symbolic - that I owed someone parts of a clock.

This makes me think that either, my interpretation, which seems like a safe bet, is somehow wrong, or that dreams/the unconscious has a completely different idea of time. I know that Jung as well as physicists like Einstein theorized that time is a construct of the mind, and that the unconscious operates outside of time and space.

It struck me as really curious that this dream which had a narrative structure, expressed across a period of time, included verbal language, and referred to a clock, yet still expressed what I assume to be a reference to time passing in such a oddly symbolic way. Like, why not just refer to time passing/wasting time?

On a related note, I read someone else's dream in another group recently which amused and interested me.. she dreamt of a cat laying on the floor, she was brushing it with a broom, and she said to the cat ""don't worry, I can stop time"".

So it seems like the unconscious can and does sometimes refer - in verbal language - to the flow of time passing. So, why was my dream so obscure in it's symbolism, or was this perhaps not its meaning?

Anyone else have references to time in their dreams, or any thoughts on the symbolism of owing parts of a clock I need to give back to someone?",03-08-2021 01:00,2.0,2,854816000000000.0,653321673.0,"Owing someone parts of a clock does sound like a reference to feeling like you owe them time.

I had a dream once where I flew across the length of an attic. When I got to the end, instead of flying through the wall and outside, I was back at the beginning again.
As I tried to fly out this kept happening. Then I noticed the objects in the attic were changing and I was going back in time. I flew out the top of the roof to get out and enjoyed a dream in the 1800's.

Another reference to time was a dream I had where a train was moving so fast it began to appear in slow motion. There was a grandfathers clock and an interesting man in the train standing next to the clock. Everything was slowed down but gravity was still changed by the speed.

I was at a beach, and there was an odd looking vehicle a bit like a tractor with its large back wheels, except this vehicle had no visible wheels at the front, and even larger rear wheels.

I was aware that it was once above the sea level, on the sandy banks of the beach, but time had passed and I then witnessed it submerged just below the surface of the sea. I saw some people disappear below the water level and apparently get into the cabin, when it then rapidly, with unusual speed power and ease, reversed out of where it was submerged sunken in the sand offshore, back up onto the high sandy banks of the beach.

Then this event was set back in time, ready to replay again, only with myself as an active participant in it, needing to prepare to do what I'd seen the people do - get into the cabin, and get the vehicle back out the sea onto the steep, sandy banks of the beach.

There were a couple of odd scenes that were never seen or featured when I witnessed the first overview of events initially, I had a one half of a plastic clip like that found on a backpack or luggage (pictured), partly broken, which was presumably attached to the vehicle at one end, that I connected to the other half of the clip presumably attached to the sandy bank, one of the actual plastic clips was broken but I connected it to the other half precariously. I recall mentioning how seemingly ridiculous this feeble link was for the job at hand. Then, equally absurdly, I was handling some thin string which again might've been attached to the clip, which I was threading onto something fixed on the bank on the beach.

Then was a sense of time urgency, and I along with a few others were standing atop the steep sandy banks of the beach, preparing to head to the sunken vehicle, submerge ourselves in the cold ocean and enter the cabin before getting the vehicle out from beneath the sea, where it was stuck deep into the sand, submerged. We were putting on wetsuits. I asked another ""do I need to take my top off?"" before putting on the wetsuit, ""yes"". Putting my arm into the sleeve of the suit I noticed just how thick the material was, several inches thick, enough to keep me from being shocked from the cold ocean temperature, so thick I might not even notice the temperature change at all.

Maybe your conscience?
It has no front wheels therefore it’s designed not to steer to the left or the right just forward and reverse and keep you on tracks d give you great traction.
The 2 functions may simply be right wrong?
The large wheels enable traction for daily life when applied daily.
At the first the Tractor is anchored on solid ground by the sea (sub conscience) the tractor was originally above sea level where the conscience is supposed to be to help us out with our daily living to make good decisions on a daily basis.
But over time time we notice the tractor has become submerged.
What caused the tractor to get submerged?
If the tractor is the conscience then it has a daily function to help us get through each day providing traction for our daily work? Then at night it rests as we sleep and the sub conscience takes over. This cycle is performed on a daily basis just like the sea. The sea also has a daily rhythm, the tide goes out the tide comes in each day.
If the tractor is your conscience but not been in operation because of other activities then it will slowly cease to function.
The tractor is anchored to the bank with a quick release clip so as to enable it to be unhitched with ease each day to drive into the sea and face the day?
Then when the tide goes out again you simply reverse yourself back up onto the bank and rest until tomorrow till the new day begins and start all over again?
But why is your tractor submerged?
Again, if the tractor is your conscience it may well be you have neglected to come out and face some of your new days thus leaving your tractor anchored in the one place on the beach?
It’s possible that the forces of nature of life itself have altered the mean level of the normal level of your tidal activity thereby flooding your tractor when not in use? When the tractor is in daily use we can be aware of the rising tide each day and make the appropriate adjustments of how far back you need to park it so that it doesn’t submerge when you awake ready for a new day? Having been neglected for some time (time passed) perhaps living in the past the tide has simply crept up on you because as you say yourself you’ve been “sleeping a lot lately)
This sleeping may be a distraction causing you to miss the daily tides?
The tractor needs to be above sea level not under it. You need it to sort through your daily life and of a night when the tide goes out your sub conscience will continue to assist you as you sleep? You can’t have the tractor submerged.
This has happened before but you’ve seen what other people have done when this happens, they (perhaps your maintenance crew simply go in and perhaps give your tractor an overhaul so it can get started again. This may be seen as a wake up call to wake you up a bit? Once the machine has been serviced and running again it’s time for you to reverse it back to saftey up on the new tidal mark on the bank and as a safety precaution you might anchor it off until tomorrow comes when it is nice and rested waiting for the new and rising tide of the new day?
This must be repeated daily. Once you miss a few tides you are then in danger of being submerged again.",28-06-2021 11:27,652,661

Just a guess here but it’s possible that you’ve been spending a lot of time on your “dream life” the place is “idyllic” that is it seems perfect for you away from the daily rough and tumble of the sea?
The place itself is in the countryside with a small building housing various crafts and pottery and it’s nice and sunny convenient to assist with the pottery? Here we possibly see the other end of your spectrum? On one hand the daily tides of life with the big decisions you need to make each day just to get through then on the other hand an ideal place in the country where you can sleep to your hearts content and be creative with your crafts and pottery in the sunny countryside. This setting is idyllic and well suited to you because the crafts relax you and you must feel at peace with yourself in this ideal setting (no big tractor here no big decisions) this idyllic place is so peaceful for you that it has caused you to sleep too much, loosing time away from the real world possibly because you may need a certain amount of rest in your life.

This is a quick release mechanism designed to be secured and unsecured with ease. The original old tractors had their implements bolted on and it was hard going to change them so they just left them on rendering the use of the tractor to only one job. Then came the 3 point Linkage set up, then what is called the quick hitch set up which allowed the operator to change the function of the tractor very quickly making it a more versatile peice of equipment all because of the quick hitch system. So to we see your quick hitch system in the plastic clip?
I’m still trying to figure this out but even as you yourself have noticed that the plastic clip and piece of string is far too feeble to hold back the big tractor? I’m just wondering about the crafts and pottery, what they represent to you? This idyllic project seems to have the effect of at least trying to anchor your tractor from moving sometimes? Your distraction may be seen as in the string as your attachment to your crafts using it to anchor your conscience to save it from entering the new day and making the decisions needed to get through the day in other words it gives the conscience a break, a rest. Even though the tractor is very powerful and provides all the traction we need to get through each day it still needs to be used, it cannot be neglected.
The plastic clip and piece of string may be your connection to your very relaxing crafts and pottery and as we realise is not strong enough to stop the tractor from becoming submerged should the rising tide come in higher than the average? It does provide great traction for life only when it is in operation each day?
It’s possible your dream is showing you about balance by showing you how easy it is to disengage from one part of your life so that you don’t suffer loss in another part of your life??? If this is so then your dream is asking you to keep and eye on the daily tides and be prepared for them each day when they come in. Also not to over indulge in the idyllic sunny countryside when you get too much relaxation and fall asleep???

First, a scene involving a pedal bike, in working order though slightly haphazard condition, the chain nearly came off but didn't, oil was needed, vegetable oil was suggested.

Next, my dad was fiddling with a newly rewired, large electrical box he'd constructed. I made a statement of it being 'the most complex for a simple operation', my dad replied that it was all good except 'occasionally doesn't work' at all. This I think was set in my childhood home, which has a workshop/studio room. Either my dad or myself commented on a cover of a plug socket being rather dirty, but on closer inspection the clear plastic cover which was semi translucent wasn't because it was dirty, but because it was the type of plastic which was glow in the dark when charged up by placing it near light first. For a good deal of time I was wandering around trying to find a light bulb to hold this piece of plastic near to see it glow, I never was able to find one. As I did, the small workshop room became a vast room the size of a large field with many people spread around the far perimeters engaged in a variety of very different activities.

Next scene, I'm at a table, outside somewhere else, with my mum and several others sat around it. My mouth feels uncomfortable and I retrieve a selection of small brown beads threaded onto on strings from my mouth. My mum makes jewelry in real life, though unlike these beads, I say 'i haven't even seen these ones before'.

A sour faced woman appeared and takes her place where I was sitting, I make a joking comment to the effect of it being okay for me to have stolen her place. She sits down, I stand beside the table. I look off to the side and see through the hedge a set of decorative stone stairs which look like an ancient oriental entrance to a temple. Then an oriental spiritual master of some sort with a dead pan expression arrives at the table and sits at the head.

Then, outside again, in some different place, a town in England.. I look at a wall leading along the side of an alley which led to an opening to a street below, it has a sign pinned on part of it with some words I forget now. As I look at it it was like a sped up timelapse occurred and the sign weathered away, deteriorated, became illegible and disappeared. The passageway beside that wall then got covered over by buildings, I sensed the route/passage had been moved to the right somewhat, like I'd witnessed the development of a town layout change over time.

I then find myself stood nearby beside my sister, still atop the slight hill in a town, I was standing in a slightly puffed up imposing way, again aware of beads in my mouth, fetching a few more up. Some people walked by, I recognised the voice of a rapper who I listened to years ago, he was rhyming aloud, I felt my mood change from my fake imposing demeanor to a happy interested one, the rapper walked on around the corner, and one of his crew, a tall guy said I should call him and get in touch.

So yeah. Thoughts? Lulz.

I tend to think the wiring, and the small room that became a big room, as well as the passageway that moved location to the right might represent changes in my psyche. And the translucent plastic plug cover that was glow in the dark might represent something mystical or consciousness related. As for the rapper, god knows, I've not listened to hip hop for ages now.",10-07-2021 04:54,,1,841343000000000.0,1043123267.0,"There are a lot of details to consider here!

The hunter who is possibly a hired professional who has skills to track the boa and although not mentioned but inferred he does do what he is hired to do when it becomes apparent who the resl snake is.
By using conventional methods your team failed to find the boa.
It was the woman using the attached reversing camera to see the 2 orbs that eventually exposed the snake.

The boa is not a threat to humans in fact the boa is sometimes used in harmony with villages and communities etc to help rid them of too many rats and mice etc. The boa in your dream is said to have killed the villagers more than likely this boa is an introduced species, a hybrid when introduced to an area can be too much competition to the local species by taking all their food and ruining the local habitat similar to feral cats in Australia which wipe out all the local wildlife in this case it’s also disrupting the villagers as well because the economic balance upon the land and wildlife is disrupted by the introduced boa who out competes the wildlife which in turn has drastic effects upon the villagers.",28-06-2021 11:28,152,460

A good guide would likely be a local,someone familiar with the villagers and the surrounding land. he would act on behalf of the villagers and the local wildlife by educating people like Richard Attenborough does.

They are both very different in their nature but up until now he has fooled the community into thinking it is the boa doing all the damage. This guide is not a native boa who represent no threat to the villagers he is the cause of them loosing their livelihoods. Being the guide he is supposed to understand the fine balance and harmony of nature with the villagers as they cohabit together. This boa behaves at odds to the native boa who keep the land clean of too many rats and mice without damaging the Enviroment which is good for the villagers. This introduced hybrid boa is the opposite in his behaviour, looks like a boa but is a rogue snake. He takes advantage of this simple harmony that exists between the balanced community and the land and its inhabitants? he is selling them short. He acts like a guide but inside he is a snake, a hybrid snake, a feral snake, a wild snake without proper thought to the economic balance of nature. he has no qualms about selling his people out and when confronted, quickly changes shape to his true identity which of course is a feral snake,not a boa! I say feral because the boa does not represent a threat to man it is the other way around it is men who use their boa skin for bags etc.this snake is a feral snake who has ruined the habitat and the lively hood of the villagers.
the orbs have not threatened the woman they have revealed themselves as the true guides of the land? When confronted with this revelation the false guide changes from a guide to a feral snake wanting to also kill the team because they have exposed him? At first he says they are the boa and then he turns into a snake. The orbs possibly the villagers and the boa are the true guides of the land who have looked after the land by their balanced lifestyle but now that balance is being ruined by the feral snake. The real boa rid the land of too many and unwanted rats and mice now take it upon themselves to expose the false guide allowing themselves to be filmed by the camera which provides proof of how they live, proof that they have not damaged the land neither each other! the villagers loose their livelihoods because of bad land practise The feral snake was easily able to disguise himself as a local boa supposedly harmless but beneficial. The local and native boa only live harmoniously and contributes to the well being of all they are true keepers of the Enviroment. They were also able to expose the fake boa as a snake!

Once the proof is exhibited the guide can no longer masquerade as a harmless boa therefore his only option is to shift back to his true self which is the snake.
As the snake changes back to its true intentions he wants to kill them however the Hunter who up until now has not been able to do his job properly because he was looking for boa not a feral snake.

The snake in the bible is similar to the snake in your dream.
The biblical serpent dress’s itself up as a Christian nice long robes declaring itself as a guide to humanity all the while ruining the balance and relationship with man and god.
In your dream the snake and the boa are of the same species but are totally different. The boa cares for the land and its inhabitants just like the Christian does but the Christian is often like the boa in your dream blamed for the damage the snake has caused.
The snake in the bible will be exposed as a snake a deceiver and a liar even though it it dressed in beautiful robes it will be cast down. The colour of the Christian is white not purple which tends to dazzle and seduce its prey a said higher enlightenment. The Christian like the villagers in your dream live a simple existence with the owner of the land and the wildlife around it. The snake on the other hand damages that very existence by treachery using trickery to entice its prey to fall from harmony with the creator.
The biblical snake is a feral Christian and will loose its place as it is also exposed as its deeds are bought to light by the woman’s / church’s proof which she will bring to the others/ the world. Then the world will see that this snake guide is not a god but only a man, a treacherous man that has caused a lot of damage.

You are studying literature in between your work schedule. This week you need to study to find the answers, next week you need to be fully competent with what you have learned.
Literature..
What Is Literature?
Simply put, literature represents the culture and tradition of a language or a people.
Perhaps on one hand (as seen in the black and white photo) you desire to study the traditions of your culture Eg literature.
On the other hand you you seem to be combining your cultural and traditional study which another side of your literature (again see black and white)
The white side of your study is open to all and perhaps public.
The black side absorbs from the white side therefore I say you are combining your study of traditional literature with deeper aspects connected to this study.
As your literature class is starting we find you have “your books” perhaps the dark/black side of learning combined with what is being taught at your class the white side.
“Your books are turned over so that the titles and authors are not exactly “visible” this is to hide your deeper study of literature and expand it to the occult.
Some of “your books” are “open” allowing others to know a little about you.
The titles are not visible but your teacher knows what you are studying just by looking at them because she is familiar with them even without knowing the titles or authors.
The teacher understands the significance of the black and white photo on your open book. Some parts of your study are open but other parts are not yet fully disclosed Just as the photo is black and white so also is the way you are learning and so also is the teacher teaching.

The headline in the photo “esotericism and the arts”

Esotericism is about secret knowledge for a small group of people.[1] Esotericism also describes mystical, spiritual or occult viewpoints (point of view).[2] Esotericism studies Gnosticism, Yoga, Alchemy, Magic, Spiritualism, Hypnosis, Astrology, Meditation, Mysticism, and Occultism. Many[who?] followers of Abrahamic faiths, particularly Christianity and Islam, have criticized Esotericism as black magic.[source?]
Esotericism in religion is called ""obscurantism"".
[source?]

Esotericism can also be about understanding symbolism and hidden meanings of many different books. They include religious books, philosophy books and books about history. They use these books as their texts.[3]

So we see the dark and black side perhaps as occultism and black magic?

What you are wanting to study on the black side is much more than your traditional culture.
The teacher begins her class with a question?
“Can you name a 19th century writer that was heavily inspired by the Occult?”

You possibly can because you have your books there which she probably knows what they are?

Not sure about this but by naming the author will reveal what you have learnt
“Can you name them” she’s asking you make known the titles of your books that you have hidden on your desk?
Perhaps by naming them they are integrated from the black side and more to the white side?

That is your dream!

As you may be aware I like studying the Bible which teaches out to all people, all nations. This in the beginning was to the Hebrews the Jewish nation. the hidden mystery’s of God have been withheld from that nation until they acknowledge their Saviour
Look..
Romans 12:25
KJ21
For I, brethren, would not have you be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits: that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.
Here we see those who progress to know the mystery’s of god have in fact been blinded to the very mystery of his son who is their saviour.
When the Jews rejected the the son of God they made themselves blind. They learned and learned but they didn’t actually know him therefore they for a time were cast off and the message of God has come to us gentile nations. We have been given the secret mystery of God if we love him

Mark 12:30
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’

This is the correct way to learn not by studying so much but by loving with all your heart and then the true mystery will open to you.

Again..

29 But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.

Notice the way to find him is with the heart and soul this is different to learning of knowledge

You should also be aware that if you keep choosing the occult then you are closing yourself off to god and perhaps inadvertently rejecting him?
This is a problem because it’s God who reveals himself to us not us the makes him found by study.
God chooses to reveal himself to us when we love him!",28-06-2021 11:29,113,965

I have been a fan of Jordan Peterson almost since he began his journey. I have found in his work a genuine desire to change the lives of those who listen to him for the better, so that we can all reach the potential that we have within us. It is for this reason I was so outraged by the superficiality and childishness in which a comic writer compared his speech to the character Red Skull. I thought that it is really unfair that in this ""cultural battle"", in which we are immersed, there is no more graphic work that contributes to balancing the political correctness that we are experiencing. So I took rule 7 from Jordan's new book and put it into practice: Work as hard as you can on one thing and see what happens.

Not all of them human. All of them were nomads, each traveling the planet they existed on. The first tribe wore brown leather clothing. This tribe’s king whilst leading his tribe lifted a scepter of gold in the air and proclaimed “I AM ONE KING, BUT TO ALL!” The planet they were on had a bright blue tint and the stars shown brightly.

The second tribe were a tribe of alien, yet humanoid people. The Queen of this tribe lifted a spear into the air and proclaimed “I AM ONE QUEEN, BUT TO ALL!” This planet was the same as the other, only because it was night time.

The third tribe were a tribe of creatures. Each person was a different shape and a different creature. One of the creatures, one of the few standing on two legs, lifted a scepter and proclaimed “I AM ONE KING, BUT TO ALL!” The planet here had a purple hue and the stars were pink.

In the 3rd planet there are creatures(not men and women yet, not fully developed, children perhaps). And one of them that stood in 2 legs(babies and infants can't walk, they crawl at best) claimed himself king again. Purple hue and pink stars! Purple is a middle ground between blue and pink. Altough children have primary sexual features as different genitalia, they don't have secondary ones that able you to differentiate unless by different clothing and haircuts and maybe behavior, but not by physical appearance, hence the colour purple.

The wise man to me represents your future self. Notice that there's a stone fence blocking your way symbolizing the obstacles you need to overcome to get where you want to be. Only then you can become king to all! They're all kings and queens in their respective planets.

and the first King of heaven and earth showing the sign of the times as the tint of blue around the earth.

We see the people are connected and have a common relationship socially and business wise.

Tribes:
a social division in a traditional society consisting of families or communities linked by social, economic, religious, or blood ties, with a common culture and dialect, typically having a recognized leader.
""indigenous Indian tribes""
Matt 24:30

New Living Translation
And then at last, the sign that the Son of Man is coming will appear in the heavens, and there will be deep mourning among all the peoples of the earth. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

Nomads:
Even though the people are nomadic they have regular trade routes
Nomads
A nomad (Middle French: nomade ""people without fixed habitation"") is a member of a community without fixed habitation which regularly moves to and from the same areas. Such groups include hunter-gatherer
s, pastoral nomads (owning livestock), and tinkers or trader nomads.
“They wore brown leather clothing”
The clothing depicts their employment as they are dressed in the skins of the herds of animals they pasture.
The brown speaks of the earthy these are nomadic people of the earth with no fixed address yet they live a nomadic lifestyle?
Hebrews 11:13
All these people died still believing what God had promised them. They did not receive what was promised, but they saw it all from a distance and welcomed it. They agreed that they were foreigners and nomads here on earth.

Their King:
“While leading his tribe, lifted his golden sceptre in the air”
The king here is possibly King Jesus as he extends the Golden sceptre to all the tribe of the earth with the message of Grace contained in the Gospel.
Now he calls forth his armies from heaven above and the earth below to meet them in the air 1 these 4:16,17,18

The Golden Sceptre:
The Golden Sceptre is most likely the greatest extended to us even when we ar in sin we are accepted in the beloved. This is the Golden Sceptre extended to us in all the world and even those who have died in faith will also rise again 1 thess 4:16,17,18 they will meet with the king and those pilgrims and strangers nomad in the air the spirit in that day to do battle against the king of the earth who fell from heaven.
See the king extending his golden sceptre to Ester the Jew. He extends the sceptre as an act of favour, he accepts her intrusion in his daily affairs of his people. If not she would be put to death.
Ester 8:3
New Living Translation
Then Esther went again before the king, falling down at his feet and begging him with tears to stop the evil plot devised by Haman the Agagite against the Jews.
8:4When the king held out the golden scepter to Esther, Esther rose and stood before the king.
8:5 “If it pleases the king,"" she said, ""and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces.

In your dream this king lifts his Golden Sceptre in the “air”
He’s lifting the sceptre declare himself the risen king in the air the higher realm. howbeit a king that bestows favour a king who is calling together his people the living and the end for the great meeting in the air.
The king is calling together all the tribes of the earth that believe in him He’scalling them upward as we’ll see the sceptre lifted in the air!
Again we see it.. “ I am one King to ALL”
Acts 4:12
And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.

The bright blue tint is a heavenly colour and with the colour brown which is earthy we can see the heaven and the earth as one and yet the journey is upwards to the air/ spiritual.
“the stars shine brightly”
This speaks of the wise ones ensued with knowledge spiritual knowledge they shine with knowledge of the higher realm.
In the bible Daniel is well known for his wisdom to know the secrets of God more than the king of Tyre even.
Daniel 12:3
Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.

So overall on the outset it looks like the nomads are the strangers Snd pilgrims of the earth nomads because they sk a new and everlasting home. They see their present abode as temporal, as is the Christian and Abraham looked on this earth look by faith for a building that has foundations. Those foundations he looked for are eternal and spiritual foundations which allow everything that is built to withstand the eons of time.
The king calls them favourably upwards to the heavenly realms with the help of the shinning stars. Tho is obviously the message of th gospel gone out into the whole world.
So we see this great king gathering his armies both from the dad and those who are still living to met their king in the air the spiritual realm to do battle with the king of the earth.

This tribe’s king whilst leading his tribe lifted a scepter of gold in the air and proclaimed “I AM ONE KING, BUT TO ALL!” The planet they were on had a bright blue tint and the stars shown brightly.

The second tribe were a tribe of alien, yet humanoid people. The Queen of this tribe lifted a spear into the air and proclaimed “I AM ONE QUEEN, BUT TO ALL!” This planet was the same as the other, only because it was night time.

The third tribe were a tribe of creatures. Each person was a different shape and a different creature. One of the creatures, one of the few standing on two legs, lifted a scepter and proclaimed “I AM ONE KING, BUT TO ALL!” The planet here had a purple hue and the stars were pink.

Here we see another planet and yet it is the same planet but with another view?

“The queen with her spear lifted up”
we see a king calling and uniting all peoples of the planet together via the Golden Sceptre the message of grace via th gospel.

Now we see the Queen by lifting up her spear in the air.
Both king and queen appeal to the air. The air is the meeting place between heaven and earth it’s the realm of the spirit.
The queen here is the church who at the moment resides in the earth but will meet with the king and his army.
They both claim royal sovereignty they both are over all. The great king and his Golden Sceptre calling with a message of grace and now the great Queen the church lifting up her spear to the air that is her weapons are not earthly as such but spiritual weapons to fight the battle of faith.
2 corinthians 10:4
The weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the world. Instead, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.

And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.

The noticeable difference is the manner in which they live are the signs of the times and can be seen in the colours.

The king lives on the planet surrounded by the blue tint suggesting the Holy Spirit circumnavigatin
g the world with his gospel messages of all the inhabitants.
Here it is.. Go into all the world, here is the tint of blue.
Matthew 16:15
And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. 16Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. 17And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; 18they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”

The queen lives in the night time which also gives us a great insight to the manner of how people live under her rule.
Note the biblical meaning to those who live in the night time..

Matthew 24:19
How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers!

Matthew 24:21
For at that time there will be great tribulation, unmatched from the beginning of the world
So we might say that the night time is a time of tribulation bought on by the heavenly king against the earthly demonic king.

Again..
notice that in the time of the queen in the night we see the beasts of the field prowling about that is the army’s looking to conquer those nations who are asleep?

Psalm 104:20
Verse Concepts
You appoint darkness and it becomes night,
In which all the beasts of the forest prowl about.
Notice the word “all”
Again..
1 Thessalonians 5:6
So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded.

Here we see the queen is not asleep but on Guard she is alert.

5:7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.

Her we see the nations are asleep they have become drunken with the wine of the worldly living and dead religion.

Again..
5:8 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.

And here we see our defence is the breastplate of faith and love is our shield

So far we see a world stage, one is looking at the king through his gathering of the tribes that is the believers the Saints.
The other is the queen a righteous queen but finding herself in the time of darkness upon the world but she is not asleep she has prepared herself for war knowing that she has help from her king with his army as well.

And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

Romans 1:25
Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

The 2 legs may represent his stable foot hold on the world not Revelation where another angel has one foot on the land and one foot on the see this being his hold over all the nations and all the peoples Eg tribes.
So we see that by standing on his 3 legs his leadership is greatly supported in the world scene.

and the old man.

First the old mans description is that perhaps of a wizard “wizened and old”
“Long hair and grown beard, brown hair colour”
This “old man” man used magic and unlike the bright shinning stars using their wisdom here we see the old man who summons help from the spirit world the demons.
Whereas the angels go about to help their king as shinning stars to proclaim the message invitation of the golden sceptre, here we see the demons are summoned to give him power which they do as seen in the crown which lifts him up in his position. This agrees also with the sceptre which he lifts that is he lifts himself into a higher position.
Note the first king is inviting all the people on the planet amid the heavenly tint of blue being the Holy Spirit whereas this king is more about building up his own royalty amid the purple that is worldly religion around his world. He makes his office higher he attempts to lift himself via his sceptre so high that he might ascend into the heavenly realms itself.

The Fall of Lucifer
12 “How you are fallen from heaven,
O 4Lucifer, son of the morning!
How you are cut down to the ground,
You who weakened the nations!
13 For you have said in your heart:
m‘I will ascend into heaven,
nI will exalt my throne above the stars of God;
I will also sit on the omount of the congregation
pOn the farthest sides of the north;
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
qI will be like the Most High.’

To the 5lowest depths of the Pit.

We also notice that the description of Lucifer is Satan and again he is described as but a “man”

North west is a direction.
The old man here seems to be having trouble locating the spot, but eventually he does locate it.. North West?
I don’t really know but I’m going to have a try?

The old man knows the locations of the other 2 planets, he also knows the condition of those planets Eg darkness in the queens planet heavenly blue in the kings planet.
He also knows the location and condition of his own planet shown buy the purple hue and pink stars.
Now he looks at a small spot on the map North West. There is no colour describing its condition except that it is blocked off, by a small stone fence? Also by the word “small spot”“blocked off”

The “spot is different from the surrounding area ..
Here it is, it’s different in COLOUR
and TEXTURE and shape being ROUNDISH
it also seems that these people are protected by the small stone fence.
Who are the people that live on the small spot that takes the interest of the old man.

spot:
a small round or roundish mark, differing in colour or texture from the surface around it.
So the spot is different from the area surrounding it?
we could say the people who live on the spot are different from the surrounding people?
We note also that the direction they live is slightly off North?

North is the direction in which The kings of Gods enemies come from.
North also means left?

North is generally what everything else is measured from so perhaps north is the headquarters of the old man but north west is a certain spot where the people don’t live according to the same laws, they live by their own laws?
If we look at the heavenly blue from the first planet and see it as the genuine message of the gospel offered by the golden sceptre then we look at the purple hue of man made religion on the old mans planet we might say that the 2 colours although similar in colour denoting religion but they are out of step with each other. One is true religion the other is a copy of religion they look alike with royal colours however everything about them is different. They live off North, different colour different shape and different texture,everyth
ing about these people is different? 2 religions but both completely different?

To they unassuming eye they look the same? Similar geological position, similar colour, living among the purple hue.
And yet the old man looks at his map on his stone table of magic.
I wonder what he is thinking?
To me it seems obvious, he wants to bring them under his control!
He want to make them obey the same laws as his people of the purple religion do?
It seems that so far he his efforts have been unsuccessful because the people who live on the spot also have stone but it is their protection and defence, seen in the small stone fence compare the stone table.
The old man summons the demons to help him which they do as seen by the crown they give him.
The crown give him authority to change laws.
Daniel 7:25
He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.

Daniel has seen it happen and now in your dream we see it again.
The crown given to the old man has enabled him more control than he previously had over world affairs.
We see this today as the race goes on to join all religions together under in umbrella. Those who refuse to become a member of the purple religion will suffer persecution because the man has just been given authority to do it by the crown given him.

Those on the North West that is those just of worldly north are the true religion waiting for the armies of the king the true king of heaven and earth.

True north is a fixed point on the globe. ... Magnetic north is the direction that a compass needle points to as it aligns with the Earth's magnetic field. What is interesting is that the magnetic North Pole shifts and changes over time in response to changes in the Earth's magnetic core.

Think what is going on in your real life then look at your dream, meditate on it. Study the meaning of the words and the characters in your dream then it will open up to you.
Eg: in your real life your girlfriend leaves you feeling stung every time you meet up?
Your dream might show you a friendly scorpion you are feeding everyday that sometimes stings you as you get close to it?
It’s up to you to study your dream Eg scorpions sting with their tail as they are close to you and looking right at you. You look at the face but as you do you get stung by the tail. Eg the face is friendly but the tail comes out of nowhere when you least expect it?
In this case you might conclude that your scorpion friend while having a friendly face allows her to get up close but her nature is to sting you? So when you see an animal you study the habits and nature of that animal which in turn will relate to that person.
Another Eg: a lioness looking after 2 Cubs and the lion bringing back prey to feed them. This is a picture of a family in their prime, strong young majestic fully functioning husband wife and children etc etc
Black and white, as compared to colour might mean no variation the situation is black and white there are very few other possibilities just black and white. Maybe animals that you see in black and white are showing you that although they have free will their lives are simple compared to ours who have all the free will to do whatever we like so our life is has lots of colour compared to the straight forward life of someone or animals shown in black and white.

To me it's the expression of feelings and emotions. Emotions mostly. So as human beings we have the blessing or curse (depending on the situation) of reflection. Animals just feel. And act upon the emotion without any kind of reflection. They can be depressed, afraid, happy, sad, excited, playfull, aroused or anything else and they just act upon it no questions asked. And its always in the moment. There's no train of thought or association to what is triggering the emotion. Its a black and white situation. Human beings on the other hand act as a whole. Your life is a complex thing. And we as humans feel loads of things at the same time, sometimes we even feel conflicted. And the difference is that we know why most of the time, and even if we don't we have the obsession about finding out. There's a plurality in us because our lifes even though are divided by moments, there's continuity to it. It's kind of hard to explain. For example a dog can be afraid and act upon it but he doesn't know why. You might be afraid for tons of reasons and you need to know why. There could be plenty of reasonable motives and you gotta narrow it down to one or several at the same time, so you can act upon it. Sure if you abuse an animal it'll traumatize it for life so there's continuity to its lifes also but not on our level. Our lifes and existence is much more complex.

I don’t know how you currently feel about your old friends…or how your subconscious is interpreting your old relationships…t

psyche. And if it’s not happy with what you’re doing, you’ll pay for it via anxiety, depression, self sabotage, etc.

My recommendation:
do some of those self authoring program things from JBP. And perhaps the personality trait stuff.

Your best friend has built up a relationship with you in the one building whilst she from her balcony looks out with you to see you in another relationship in the other building “like the one you are in”
There is some sort of dynamic going on here. You and your friend are “best friends” giving you and her a special place that perhaps your ex relationship did not have?
Notice it’s you and your best friend “we were together”
again the suggestion is that you and you friend’s relationship is stronger than that of you and your ex’s relationship.
As we keep looking we almost see the 2 of you conspiring to end the relationship with your ex?
Notice it’s “as we talked” it’s the 2 of you talking together On how to end your relationship with the other person.
Again the result of your talk is that we see you agree with each other what has been discussed “ok, let’s do it”
Because the dream is hers it seems like she wants you to end your relationship with the other person? The 2 of you have devised a plan on how to end the relationship “and I pulled out a gun” the significance of the gun means your solution will be final, that is your plan. Notice that you “point” the gun at the building, that is the relationship.
When you fire the gun it’s actually dark so you can’t really see the damage you cause and yet you realise that it it you that has been shot?

The darkness here may represent what you are doing unconsciously see biblical scripture..
1 Thessalonians 5:7
You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled
. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
Notice the dark and the night represent that you are not alert and don’t really know what you are doing?

“I couldn’t see anything when i shoot”
Here it is, the dark is you doing this in the night under the wrong circumstances, also by firing into the building in the dark means the way you are going about ending the relationship will surely end it but doing it in the dark means that you really don’t know how to do it?
What you have done in your friends dream is end it by taking yourself out of the relationship which the 2 of you coming from her have both decided upon. Your friend wants you to end the relationship but she also wants it to come from you? Subconsciously she wants you to shoot/kill the part of you that is in the relationship with the other woman. Please do not mistake kill literally in the dream it means to take you out and totally away from your ex. This is what your best friend is wanting.
Notice she only asks you to shoot at the relationship however the consequences of that shooting means that you are the one who is wounded? This “she couldn’t believe I did it” is almost suggesting that now that you’ve done what she wanted there is no real promise of anything more because she doesn’t allow herself to “believe”
“And we went home” again the idea her seems that after you end the relationship you go home together but she “couldn’t believe” meaning if she can’t believe the she can’t give more?
Later you find the person in the building/ relationship who has suffered is not your ex but you! You are the one that is dead left with out feelings and at a loss. Your friend wanted you to shoot the relationship but in doing so it is you who is the one who is now damaged and I’m not sure how your friend feels about that? Remember she couldn’t have the capacity to believe in you. Perhaps your best friend is suffering low self esteem?
“People were very angry? Well you would be angry? Your ex would be angry?
Surely once they realise that your best friend conspired to end the relationship that people now want justice. Now we speak of the day now you are starting to think clearly and alert?
The justice here is not you so much being shot but the conspiring in the night in the dark to hurt your ex and damage you?",28-05-2021 11:32,240,876

So this guy Paul is being persecuted by the Jews for teaching something outside of their authorised, traditional religion, and he calls living with persecution a ""thorn in his flesh,"" which I suppose is like saying they're a pain in the neck.

He says no matter how much he prays this ""thorn in his flesh"" doesn't go away, i.e. he keeps getting persecuted. Some people speculate that it was a personal problem, a sin/temptation he couldn't overcome. Nothing indicates that to me, as he mentions the persecutors directly, but in a way whether it's external opposition or internal temptation, the same lesson can be learned.

Paul concludes that God's grace is sufficient for him, not necessarily meaning that it's good or God agrees with him struggling, but even in the event of the struggle never going away, the comfort of the kindness of ""all of the good potential of being"" in his life or of your significant other, for example, is sufficient to more than compensate for some troubles that don't leave us for some reason.

So I don't know whether there are some particular people or obstacles in the path towards your ideal goals and state of being or even if you do have a personal struggle you want to overcome that nothing has worked against so far, but 1. the grace of God or all of the good potential of being and your significant other may be sufficient for you to *live with that pain in the neck AND 2.

Wasps have slender waists and almost hairless legs. They have biting mouth parts and 12 or 13 antennae.
Your wasp is nasty.
Nasty: behaving in an unpleasant and spiteful way.

we have a slender waist wasp behaving in a spiteful way?

you try to get rid of it because of the way it behaves itself.
Your wasp has attached itself to you and most likely sees you and your surroundings as a good nesting place and provision of food.
But you have put up with it and it’s behaviour but now realise it doesn’t belong with you?

You are frightened of getting stung but you aren’t stung because the wasp needs you for her nest?
Notice how the wasp hovers over you, that is to “remain” in one place with you in your place!

You have endured the wasp but you understand you can’t live with it.
It’s seems as though this wasp is in some sort of a relationship with you but now you understand you can’t actually live with it?
After trying everything to get rid of it you now try to kill it off, that is to get rid of it out of your life. Look how you do that..you use a BOOK. Most likely a book that contains certain rules for life that will cause you and her to seperate? That book may be a bible if similar?
But your wasp is not affected by your book of life at all because her need to build a nest with a good provider is inherently instinctual?
You try to hit it hard by just at first using the front page that is you are hoping the actual name of the book compounded with what’s written in the book will add enough weight to get rid of it out of your life?

SO: I don’t understand SO?
Perhaps your partner?

S.O. is the abbreviation for significant other which could mean a spouse, life partner, or someone in a long-term, committed relationship.

You say you are happy to have your SO “around” just around? You say “at times” she makes you feel supported by her being there “around”?
On one end of your spectrum you have a nasty spiteful wasp, but on the other end your SO makes you feel good “at times”and “you like having her” “around”

Just as you have enjoyed the company of your SO being around to make you feel good so to is the wasp enjoying having you around to make her feel good. Your reasons are different from hers? Yours are to feel good hers are probably a nesting place?

Note one particular solitary wasp below. They lay there eggs a the nest of a bee or wasp.
The larvae hatching from those eggs feed on the bee or wasp and the food provided by their parents.

The premise seemed entirely non sequitur; some people I was with, of whom I didn’t know, wanted to plant sod right on the beach by the waterline of this lake. Why? I have no idea. The lake was infested with alligators, you could see them floating everywhere like deadwood. One of the people I was with attempted turning the soil over by the edge of the water, and was promptly jolted back by a lunging alligator. This deterred us for sometime. But then, the scene changed. Suddenly I was in the water, not just on top of the water, but swimming deep underneath. I found myself all the way at the bottom, inside an underwater cave. At this moment, I began to see a shark moving towards me. It was blocking my way out. I knew if I was going to survive, something drastic needed to take place right then. Strangely enough, I morphed into a shark myself. I remember thinking to myself at this moment, “but he’s been a shark all his life, he could surely best me, so what do I do?” I made the decision at this point, to charge directly at the circling shark with no hesitation and all the faux confidence I could muster. When I did so, the shark turned his side to flee, now perpendicular to me, and I rammed directly into his blindside. This startled him more than enough, and I escaped the cave from which I was corned in. I get the jist of the narrative, but I’m confused as to whatever symbolism lies behind. I searched the web for shark symbolism, especially to do with dreaming, and none of it resonated with how I felt in the dream. Maybe it’s just, “sometimes the only way to defeat a bloodthirsty shark is to become one yourself”. Thanks everyone for any input you have.

I am sorting things on my grandmother's dining table, moving them from a cardboard box into a large trunk. Grandmother has died, and this is either my inheritance, or things that were already mine but kept in her house. My parents are packing up and sorting things in other parts of the house. When my father asks me if I am ready to leave, I ask for more time. He takes note of my short black skirt and asks if it is new. I answer that it is. All of my clothing is black, possibly because I am in mourning. He then goes off to some other part of the house to continue his sorting. I am sitting down on the floor to continue looking at the various objects, loosing myself in memories. My skirt is now a a short red kilt. I adjust my thick black stockings, pulling them up over my knees, more for warmth than anything else. One of the objects I remember is a dark wooden statue of St. Peter holding a key, which I have in fact inherited from my grandmother in waking life. It used to stand in her living room.
When my father comes back a couple of hours later, he is noticeable annoyed that I am taking so much time. He is almost done sorting and packing. I tell him that I am now done and we can go. He can either drive me home, or I can take the subway. As he drives me to their house, he continues ranting about how much time I took. At the time we have reached my parents house, I have had enough and start shouting at him that he didn’t have to wait for me. He could just have gone home if he wanted, but now he has gotten more done today than expected, so he should thank me rather than complain. He now looks confused and asks me we he should be grateful to me.
I wake up and my cat walks over my chest.

I am sorting things on my grandmother's dining table, moving them from a cardboard box into a large trunk.

When my father asks me if I am ready to leave, I ask for more time. He takes note of my short black skirt and asks if it is new. I answer that it is. All of my clothing is black, possibly because I am in mourning. He then goes off to some other part of the house to continue his sorting. I am sitting down on the floor to continue looking at the various objects, loosing myself in memories. My skirt is now a a short red kilt. I adjust my thick black stockings, pulling them up over my knees, more for warmth than anything else. One of the objects I remember is a dark wooden statue of St. Peter holding a key, which I have in fact inherited from my grandmother in waking life. It used to stand in her living room.
When my father comes back a couple of hours later, he is noticeable annoyed that I am taking so much time. He is almost done sorting and packing. I tell him that I am now done and we can go. He can either drive me home, or I can take the subway. As he drives me to their house, he continues ranting about how much time I took.

THE SHORT BLACK DRESS
In your dream your grandmother has died and while reflecting on her life you are caused to reflect on your own life through your father who is also sorting and packing in the same house.
As you sort through looking for your own things and perhaps anything from your grandmother and reflect on the articles your father approached you and asks you “if you are ready yet” in other words you should be ready by now because you’ve had enough time?He does manage to cause you to become self conscious when he points out that “you are wearing a new short black dress.
Maybe your father represents God and tries to point out that you cannot fully respect the dead the way you are dressed baring too much skin
The cardboard box is lifeless and may represent your grandmother or the religion she is connected to?
The trunk is possibly you, the natural timber still alive with a larger capacity to store things
You are dressed in black for morning the death of your grandmother and take your time to absorb what she may be passing on to you? The new dress may be a new experience for you, death what does it really mean?
Contained within the articles are things meant for you but to understand exactly what they are and what they mean you need “time” to reflect on the articles.
But now your father wants to go and he asks you “are you ready to leave” But you are definitely not ready to leave “and ask him for more time”
At this point he notices your “short black skirt” possibly suggesting that even though you are dressed as for morning you are not that serious, but as you sort through and reflect you actually do start to become serious about it. Here we notice your “short skirt” it does at first seem respectable enough but as your father noticeably points out it’s “short” makes you more self conscious and aware especially since you are in the reflecting mode and now you start to question yourself. Your life up to now has been short and there has been no time to reflect upon it until now. Your fathers observation has pricked your conscience suggesting your behaviour is irreverent. Before you never had time however the death of your grandmother affords you the necessary time you need to reflect on your short life and perhaps if you are patient and take more “time” and see if you can find some answers within your grandmothers things. The cardboard box has things you need to look at.The dinning table is a place to gather, your thoughts and share emotions and of reflect on life. This is important now and you realise by the way you are dressed your father might be right? You realise you need more “time” time to find answers and time to reflect and time to find the goodness within your grandmother.
At your request your father goes off to continue packing so as to give you more “time”

After you find the KEY your father comes back after a few hours and he is noticeably annoyed? If Your father represents God why then is he annoyed?
He caused you to contemplate right? He caused you to find the KEY right? You do have the the key of life right?
He seems annoyed that you are now taking so much “Time” but this is Now the fathers time you are taking God has at great cost provided you with the Key of Life Chist his son whom religion has rejected. Of course the Father is annoyed and entitled to ask “if you are ready now” after all he has just given you the keys to the kingdom therefore it is TIME to be ready.
You tell him you are done and ready to go home with him.
But on the eat home you begin to argue with him. You have not recognised the father in your dream he is the one who gave you time to find the key of Peter.
He’s there but you don’t see it and begin to fight with him. You give him an ultimatum declaring you can find your own way home and don’t really need him.
Your father is here as the great Sheppard we are all as lost sheep and he as the great Sheppard making sure you find your way home.

As you are being driven home you say he rants about how much “time” you took.
The rang is probably the messsge of the gospel telling you thst now is the time?

""And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.""
Romans 13:11, KJV
""(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)""
2 Corinthians 6:2, KJV

As you reach your parents house you shout and argue you are not listening, you had an experience but you are not aware of how he is so willing to show up in your life to help you.
Unfortunately it gets worse! As he gets you home you begin a new tirade by telling him (Jesus) that he should be grateful to you! You have not noticed how patient he was with you waiting for you all this time to find the KEY to life but now you treat him badly. You make him out as miserable and impatient but in fact he has been patient and understanding and he has given you much time to sort yourself out! Your ungratefulness is even more apparent when you now tell him that he has gotten all this work done today because of you and that he should thank you for it!
This again reveals your spiritual condition yet he seems so to persevere with you after all he is your father and loves you so.
Your father now looks confused and rightfully asked you why should he be grateful to you after all he is the one who died for you not you for him.
This question is designed to awaken your consciousness again but still you’re not seeing it?
As you wake up a cat walks over your chest. I don’t really know except that when a cat walks over you it wants attention but we need to realise we can’t keep walking over Christ to get his attention

The 3rd skirt is in fact a “mini skirt” Green and according to Carole Heffner the Catholic meaning for the green colour is of ORDINARY TIME the time between the feasts how interesting again the word “time” comes up. Let’s see where this leads us as I must admit I’m not sure where this is going yet?
Your second dream now finds you standing in front of a big door in a city with some students?
The big door sounds similar to the scripture..
Matt 7:13
New International Version
""Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.

New Living Translation
“You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.
So we see the big/broad gate in your dream which suggests that many have entered by this way, however your group is a group of students? Students study. First we saw reflection the contemplation now actual study. The black and white pictures suggest the old history of the great church and what will your group find?
To help us understand that perhaps we should look at the green mini skirt? First we see the length is not only short like the others but “mini” and this style like the others can be paired with leg-inns and also for warmth. The mini skirt is designed to bare a lot of skin and became prominent in the 1960s but what has this got to do with your group of students and the big gate? Well it seems at this period of time the mini skirt is related to the feminist movement and more a time of women’s liberation, the mini skirt also relates to the retaining of youthfulness as well as a protest against male authority.
Green is the colour of healing and nature. The ordinary time described by Carol of the Catholic Church a time between feasts almost says that in between these feasts there is a time when people tend to forget about Gods timetable and quickly forget and start getting involved in what they feel is more important to them. Moses experienced the same thing as he was gone longer than expected the people rose up to play they forgot about God not realising there is still more to come. The feminist movement and the barring of there skin are acts of the flesh and because they indulge in these thing they don’t realise their TIME IS RUNNING OUT",28-05-2021 11:34,534,479

The road takes you on a pathway to a new place however it’s the journey that is highlighted here.
Your dream and your comments reveal 2 figures who have some understanding about snakes.
You have said that “I’ve encountered snakes in my last job”
As well the bird in her job also encounters snakes in her job.
The bird knows her job with snakes well. She doesn’t muck around she attacks the seemingly small snake 3 times. Let’s look. Firstly she reveals the snake “hiding in the grass” the bird takes no chances she will either eat the snake or act protectively since she knows the snake is a threat to her family.
You on the other hand look at the snake and because of its small size deem it harmless. Note the difference between you and the bird.
The next thing we notice is what happens in the pursuing 3 attacks. On the first attack the birds keen eye for danger reveals the hiding place of the snake “the short grass” which is beside the road you use to take this new journey. The short grass suggests it’s drought resistant quality however not quite enough coverage to escape the keen eyesight of the bird who is always on guard.
The bird is teaching you what to look for and how to behave on your journey since the small size does not cause her to see the snake as harmless.
The bird attacks the first time but the snake by changing its shape manages to find a way out of the birds beak. The snakes is adaptable firstly hiding in short grass then when cornered simply twisting itself or changes its shape to release itself.
The second attack is different, the bird and the snake struggle but the “harmless snake” actually bites the bird causing the bird to drop the snake in front of you. Now the snake is fully exposed right in front of your eyes and what does it do, it now bites you because as as the bird is a threat so too are you a potential threat but unlike the bird you still see the snake as harmless until you also get bitten. So I said the bird is teaching you not to see the small snake as entirely harmless. The bird attacks the snake for the third time after having bitten both of you and still the struggle goes on.
In your last job, before you climbed the stairs you worked with snakes enough to know that small snakes don’t pose a real threat however after you climb to the staircase you still apply the same logic in the same old way but the behaviour of the bird now teaches you something new, that is in your new life journey you might consider that even small snakes can hide in short grass and still have the capacity to bite especially once they are exposed.",28-05-2021 11:35,160,569

I think there is some bit of it that is false due to normalcy bias. i.e. Victorian era women perhaps should not be viewed as the “standard” female. Does that make any sense? Sure, us men very much like that, and it is an attractive quality, but perhaps it is the exception throughout history and not the norm.

If you read the literature regarding the differences between men and women, you find that there is a high degree of overlap.

While I agree that there has been a shift as of late in women adopting historically “male” behaviors, perhaps it can be viewed as a consequence of the alleviation of the need to suppress those behaviors.

Going to greek/roman mythologie we have Venus, The Moon, Mars, the Sun. Venus is the sensual, enjoyment of life, attraction of what I want and need (one way to see Venus incarnated are flowers). Mars is the complement of Venus, I go get my goals, I go fight for what I want, agression, impulse, courage. We have the sun, I shine, I allow myself to be who I am, I materialize my needs. The moon, i nurture, I protect, i manage and protect my emotions, i am safe place. With the birth and expansion of Abrahamic religions with all the good they brought they also came with baggage, part of it is that these archetypes were restricted to men and women. Men were allowed and encouraged to embody the Mars and Sun archetypes but not the Venus and Moon archetypes. Women were limited to the moon archetype, that is Mary. I nurture, i am the safe place where others grow from. It is a beautiful archetype but not the only one. Venus was casted away and feared for the power the release of sensuality and the power of attraction women can have on men.

Men AND women need to embody abd integrate these four archetypes. The limitations women faced and the restriction to only the moon/Mary archetype generated over centuries a rejection of that archetype and a longing for the counter part which is Mars.

All in all I think we can understand why the behavior of radical feminism has taken some of the shape it has. Our society still has miles to walk for men to embody also the moon archetype, the nurturing, emotional and I provide safety part of themselves, and to learn to manage themselves when women are allowed to fully embody the Venus archetype.

It sets out on a calm sea, suggesting that the opportune time is right to embark on this mission.
You do have a destination but it’s on an unseen shore, somewhere.
It’s not that you don’t know where you’re going because you do, it’s just at the moment unseen, and it’s not like it’s nowhere in fact it is somewhere, it is a real place you have set off towards.
It’s the way you are getting there that is the question not how because we know how, it’s on the big ship, organisation? You are sitting on top of the load because you are responsible to make sure this load of hay reaches its destination.
The how you reach and arrive suggests it will be by faith. The supplies and transport you are already a part of but the journey into the destination is unseen suggesting it is a journey by faith.
Note Abraham;
Heb 11:8
New International Version
By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.

Notice the “voice” that you “sense” of someone not seen in the dream as compared to the “words” of your own dismissing this “suggestion”
Notice the battle going on in your mind? You have set out on a journey with a load of supplies/hay and you are responsible to see that it arrives safely at this unseen destination. But now doubt sets in as we see your senses making suggestions to you that it’s perhaps a waste of time because there’s only goats at your destination again suggesting it’s a waste of good supplys just for a population/
group of goats? This creates doubt and the thoughts are activated by fear.
Let’s look at how you turn the battle, after you “sense” the “voice” you now “hear” “words”
This is very different because your words are containers also and they contain faith and with this faith you dismiss the “incorrect notion” that “someone else had made”
This is a battle going on in your mind you set out with confidence you set out with supplies for sheep and cattle because they are the ones who more likely feed on hay although goats eat hay they mainly forage not graze.
So the doubt that someone is trying to place inside your head is that the group you are sending supplies to are not even worthy of the supplies/vast amount of nutritious food. You correct this foolish notion with words not senseless notions.
You overcome your struggle to reach your destination where in fact where there are no goats.
So then if you have reached your destination who then is the vast amount of hay/nutritious food for?
We can identify the group since we know what animals eat hay and that is sheep and cattle rather than goats who are not there anyway.
John 21:17
New International Version
The third time he said to him, ""Simon son of John, do you love me?"" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, ""Do you love me?"" He said, ""Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you."" Jesus said, ""Feed my sheep.

What we are seeing is a man taking a courageous journey by faith and in calm seas but buffeted by the senses rather than the waves.
Notice how it is faith that is required when venturing into things not seen.

Hebrews 11:1-6
King James Version
11 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

More understanding on the things which are seen and things which are not seen

3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

....

There were many who were living in the caves. I can't remember exactly why we all moved there, but it was to defend ourselves.

The girl asked me to help find her female friend. I liked the girl, I was interested in her, she was friendly and pretty -\-\ it would be a pleasure to help her out.

So we went inside the caves under the earth. As we went down under it became darker and darker, she started to become scared the deeper we went. I though that was cute, and started guiding her with more care.

We arrived at a dark chamber, where many there lay sleeping on the floor. It was there between the many lying bodies that her friend was to be found. We approached them. Using my cellphone light to try and find her.

I exclaimed to her silently ""there she is!"". She did not answer.

Immediately I head an attack -\-\ she attacked the sleeping girl! It wasn't an innocent girl trying to find her friend, it was an assassination! I was shocked, and didn't know what to do, it was completely dark and she was armed with a knife. I was at that second hesitating, about to attack her, when I woke up.",29-04-2021 16:22,0.0,1,801436000000000.0,1721451638.0,"I find it interesting that people bring up dreams from so long ago, how they stay with us, and moreover, why they come back up into our consciousness atparticular points in time so long after the dream.

Did it just spring to mind, I guess? Or did something in particular prompt it can you recall?

Interesting dream. I guess from a Jungian perspective the girl/s could be seen as your anima symbols, and the dark underground perhaps your deep unconscious. The surprise assassin is an interesting twist. I love how dreams, though supposedly coming from our own minds, can spin a story and lead us to a point without us suspecting what's about to happen, then surprise us! It's like they don't come from our self at all.

If characters in dreams should be aspects of ourselves, then if the underground is the unconscious, the assassin motif leads me to consider a repellent/
repressed type behaviour.. a 'friend' being someone that they are related to, a repressed aspect of ourselves sure,bolised as someone dormant, sleeping.

I guess what you said at the start, that the people below ground, 'we were there to defend ourselves'. That too sounds like the way people judge against/
repress certain traits, as when people try to repress an agressive side to survive in polite society.

A number of my recent dreams feature friends from high school, and a general feeling of my own low sense of self worth, inadequacy, failing in life, not living up to my potential..

The scene that was most vivid was the scene before I awoke.

I was at the edge of a river. The river wasn't among greenery, nor in open landscape, but was enclosed, steeped up both sides, perhaps by rock, the other side was vertical as a wall, the side I was on sloped more gradually down to the waters edge.

On the far side was a large wooden boat, its hull was standing tall many meters above the waters surface with many life size wooden figures on it like a carved sculpture, the boat was fixed in place, as were the wooden figures.

To my right, on the side of the river I was on, was a much smaller boat, and again there were wooden figurines which where positioned in a line as though walking toward the direction of the front of the boat, again fixed still, inanimate, those towards the back of the procession were above the water level, those towards the front progressively submerged as though depicting them walking into and beneath the water. Perhaps they were not actually on the little boat, or perhaps the boat too was submerged at the front, I think the boat was on top of the water, but the procession of wooden figurines were walking into the river in front of the little boat.

I noticed a woman unknown to me, who was wearing brown/red earthy colored clothes, and I sat down at the side of the river bank, sitting in the shallow water there, with a sense of some sexual connotation by doing so.",26-04-2021 00:34,1.0,1,799950000000000.0,780839497.0,"It strikes me as a comparison dream with the two sides of the river, the sloped vs the cliff, along with the small vs the large boat.

At first glance the dog is suggestive of mans best friend and even a helper, however we notice your dog is a yellow dog, suggesting a further meaning beyond just that of a friendly helper?
the word you use to further describe your dog is ""exotic""
meaning; unusual and exciting because of coming from a far away especially a tropical country.
so now we have an exciting and unusual dog who comes from far away and is naturally meant to be helpful and friendly to people in your neighborhood, we don't yet know if this dog has a bite to it? (maybe by now you know who the yellow dog is?.
The Lioness of some kind.
The lioness meaning is the model for a woman, shes magnificent full of passion and beauty her presence is commanding and she protects her young. they are independent fierce loyal and brave and they are the primary hunters for their pride.
as with the dog who is given a descriptive yellow colour the lioness also is given us further description.
The biting down affectionately,
without hurting you seems to be what a lioness would do to lovingly carry her young with her teeth without hurting them.
The next thing we see is you snuggling into the lioness, shes a loving mother and you are her cub.
but now we see that this fierce mother figure who is protective of her cubs and bites without hurting has your hand in its mouth.and yet she is not biting to hurt, she was affectionate.
what is she doing? i
It does seem she is leading you? its possible that you have become a dog handler now your lioness is handling you in the right direction perhaps. you can be sure of this as compared with the exotic dog where you don't really know what to expect? the idea i get here is that i wouldn't be too trusting to allow the yellow dog to have your hand in its mouth?
this affectionate scene reminds you of the house cat perhaps your real mother who used to do the same thing to play bite while all the while protecting you.
you are conscious of other people watching, perhaps they think the treatment you are getting is over the top but you assure them its quite ok.
at the last we see the lioness tightening her grip on you you but still not hurting you.
so here it is its a ""struggle"" for you and as you continue to struggle your lioness continues to tighten her hold on your arm.
the yellow dog in your dream is supposed to be friendly and helpful however this dog has not displayed any of these loving attributes at all, unlike your lioness who has done a wonderful job of loving you and looking after you.",28-05-2021 11:37,175,518

There was an apartment full of my ex-wife and her siblings, but they weren’t her real siblings. They were in the process of moving out of the apartment. I was there, frantically going from person to person, trying to figure out what was going on. It seemed to everyone like the most natural thing in the world, and my vehement protest was viewed as outlandish and inappropriate. I was distraught and desperately tried to make them see. “What is going on!?”

Then I was riding a horse through a sort of natural area, a national park. I saw that some belts had been discarded. I picked one up like a whip. I rode my horse downhill. It was hilly country, with grass and water and a view of a far distant country at a lower elevation.

Then I was back at the apartment. There was a Asian person there, of ambiguous gender. I asked this person to come back to the bedroom with the aim of seducing them. They didn’t know what I wanted and they got uncomfortable and finally said “oh, for some reason I thought you wanted to...” then my ex-wife’s sister came back (but not the real one) and we looked out the back window to see that there was a small prototype fighter jet being worked on by a couple of people, a woman and some children. “Jet fuel?” I asked. “That would be your low-grade test fuel,” the sister replied matter-of-factly.",20-04-2021 05:02,0.0,2,796012000000000.0,100001000000000.0,"Nice to hear you had a wedding to attend, which may symbolise the integration of a complex into the psyche if which you have no conscious idea.

I was with a group of men/new acquaintances (reminded me of a Mardi Gras krew) at a posh modern open air restaurant-like courtyard area, standing at a black bistro height table. All the surrounding buildings and courtyard walls were white. There were six of us and a television on a nearby wall was on and blaring some E-Entertainment type story about Dr Jordan B. Peterson. The TV announcer/host was commenting on “the JBP phenomena sweeping the country” and the voice asking the typical troupes; “Is Peterson misogynistic or not?”

We’re all enjoying light hearted banner and seem to be waiting for a dining table or something.

Suddenly, the HULK rushes up to our table and says “Me just want to bowl!” and pounds the edge of our round table causing a large piece to break off and I notice the table is made of concrete. Then HULK rushes a few yards away, grabs a bowling ball and flings it at some pins and they explode from the force as he nails a strike. I hear my sister say “That was so dangerous, someone could have been hurt.” and I think how it was just HULK having some rowdy fun. And I consider how I could tell her this and also realize how she would likely not be amenable to this view.

Then a waiter appears at our table to tell us the restaurant is ready for us and for us to get ready to prove we’re ready for them and then he yells “Go!” (Like someone shouting to begin a race.) We immediately pickup the table (we’re now handcuffed to it) and begin running with it. We’re all dressed in dark suits and white shirts and moving quickly, huffing and puffing, with the table between us that’s now rectangular, like a casket and I realize this is what we do to get into this restaurant. We must compete to be worthy to gain entrance.

We started in Los Angeles and we’re now in New Orleans and the voice over is saying this is the thing “sweeping the country” as we jog/run along one of the men grabs my right leg and pinches hard saying he’s going to hold on and rest and I say “the hell you are”and knock his hand away and then we have to climb a tall white wall (with a barred window at the top) with the concrete table and get our table/casket over in order to gain entry and we do and we make it and we collapse with our table in an outdoor courtyard as I realize the restaurant and view is exactly like the place we just began.",11-04-2021 15:33,1.0,6,792688000000000.0,100001000000000.0,"I see at least 4 groups here so I will quickly mention them to give us a guide as I attempt to follow through your dream..
First group is your secret group of 6 men aligned with the Madigras group who display and exhibit festival platforms publicly in the open air, in the streets to interact with the public.

Second group is Jordan Peterson’s public group using tv and online internet platforms to interact with the public.

Third group is the public themselves using both the street festivals and tv on the wall and internet, “open air” to interact with your group, the Madigras and Peterson’s group, the sweeping phenomena. This interaction is achieved through the tv host who through their tv programs, platforms scrutinise his publicity and his idea’s.

4th group are the church’s, one of which you also belong to as you yourself say “irregular Methodist” may be seen in your dream as the “restaurant” which offers exclusive membership asking potential members to “ prove themselves upon joining. The other church group is obviously the Roman Catholic Church who are behind the Mardigras group.

What’s being played out here is the interaction between these groups and yourself since you are in fact a member of all of the groups.
Perhaps the schism created for you is the oathes you have to gain membership to the secret 6 man group which of course the Methodist group would be opposed to.

It’s basically a public trial in the “open air”Madigras street festivals and tv, online and street platforms. Peterson group “sweeping phenomena”

1st paragraph
You are with a “group” of 6 men, they are “new acquaintances” suggesting you may have just joined or different to your normal acquaintances?
“This reminds you of the Madigras”
The 6 man group connected to the Mardigras group are very different to your other Methodist group?

See New Orleans 6 natives from Mobile who started the secret organisation of Krewe of Cosmos,these are likely the group you may have joined
Your dream says you are “with this group” they are “new acquaintances” but you are also with the church group, the irregular Methodist?
A posh modern open air restaurant..
The open air possibly relates to what I mentioned above, the open air street festivals and the open air online platforms. Both very public.

The restaurant in your dream is indoors, with a bistro outside.

The purpose of the Bistro is a place for your group to wait while membership, a table is ready and prepared inside.
You stand at the bistro you sit at the restaurant, the bistro is denoted as black while the restaurant white.
Standing at a black bistro Hight table..
The bistro is a fixed menu of counter food, the restaurant Is more food ordered to taste.
The bistro is cheaper the restaurant is dearer.
The bistro bar is high and black.
The restaurant walls are white
Your group of 6 are waiting, standing in the bistro for a seat to be made ready in the Restaurant.
6 men in your group not only refers to the Krewe of Comos started in 1869 but in the church sense is the number of man himself, created on the 6th day fallen from grace and separated from god being cast out of the garden/
restaurant. Man has always desired to return to his original and eternal state, he no longer wants to be outside of the garden/ bistro but inside the restaurant/ garden of Eden.
We notice the television is on the white wall of the restaurant suggesting Jordan Peterson’s alignment with the church.
I see both attempts at alignment are weak at best, your alignment coming from the Methodist church with the Madigras is as you said “irregular” and Peterson’s alignment with the church is also “irregular”
Your secret group uses the troupes and outdoor festivals, Peterson’s group the tv and internet. Both groups are trying to get their message across.

So how are the both groups going so far?
I notice that Peterson’s group has a voice in the restaurant, the tv on their whitewall of the church.
Your group is still outside in the bistro, waiting for a decision from the restaurant of whom Peterson has a say. He is inside the restaurant you are still outside in the bistro in the Court yard of public opinion, street festivals, tv and internet platforms similar to the platforms used of by the troupes in the mardigras. This is all seen as entertainment “blaring out from the tv” and the troupes platforms as they entertain with their “throws” the beads designed to arouse the public.
Since Peterson has a voice already in the restaurant and your group doesn’t the tv host comes out with a trick question asking The typical troupes, “is JB Peterson misogynistic or not”

This is a cunning question ..
He is being asked if women are free to do what they want? It seems like a trick question? If Peterson says they are not free to do what they want then he is judged as misogynistic but if he says they are free to make their own decision then why can’t they do what they want also? And so the debate is played out in public.
Is this question an attaché to the original question at hand, if the men’s group are wanting membership o the church restaurant then so also the women should also be accepted as embers to do as they want?

Waiting for a table..
.You are still on the outside of the main Resatautant/
church you are waiting in the COURTYARD in this case in full view of the world,
perhaps for a decision on whether or not you will even be allowed in? So for now you are annexed of in the bistro area, not completely out but not completely in?
Suddenly the hulk rush’s up to our table saying “me just want to bowl”..he wants to put on an exhibition of how he is going to bowl over the show if someone doesn’t make up their mind to let him in?
The ball is Christ our rock, the 10 skittles are the 10 commandments, shaped in a triangle is the triune fullness of God.
The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist. The two exist as independent dissociative personalities, and resent each other.
Here we see the chemically induced Bruce Banner changing into the incredibly strong super hero.

“And pounds the edge of our round table causing a large piece to break off and I notice the table is made of concrete.
What we see here is mild mannered Bruce changing into this strong man the hulk when he gets impatient. The concrete table is a man made agreement possibly the religious agreement man has made with god which seems devoid of the blood as it’s chief chemical, it’s the blood that has more power than the hulk but this table lacks heavenly material. Now the hulk looks at this concrete table tablet and makes a mockery of it smashing it with his human strength alone. After he destroys and smash’s what’s left of their agreement with God he then further proceeds to smash up Gods agreement with the restaurant.
The hulk rush’s a few yards away ..
After breaking his groups agreement he now proceeds to destroy Gods agreement..
“Grabs a bowling ball and flings it at some pins..
Her we see him mocking at Christ the head of the church using him to smash the 10 commandments an allusion to Moses who breaks the tablets of God when he finds out the people have broken the laws while he was in the mountain with God. Also the mockery it towards David Who beheaded the Giant. The hulk uses Christ’s beheaded head seen as the rock bowling ball and the David’s slingshot is seen as the Head/ball/ used as the slingshot that he “flings” toward the 10 skittles, that is the 10 laws of God. The triangle shape of the skittles represent the triune nature of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit which your group obviously don’t believe in? This mocking of Christ and David clearly reminds us of Goliath standing “ a few yards of” the Israelites camp
mocking them saying where is your champion to come out and fight him?
Hulk hurls the rock ball toward the pins like a stone is flung from a slingshot, the skittles explode from the force as he nails the first strike/pin/ skittle Another allusion to Christ is he was smitten for our transgressions and then nailed to the cross. Also a steady dismantling of the laws of God in the church community. The hulk on behalf of the 6 man group understands that if he can destroy the laws of God there is nothing to bind them to holiness and the covenant between man and god is gone, there is nothing stopping him from entering the restaurant the temple the church, once he enters he knows the temple will be desecrated and God cannot live there and the church will no longer have a mediator to heal them from their sins. They will loose their strength.
By destroying the teachings of Christ and the Apostles by twisting the scriptures he tries to use the words of God to suit himself eg why are you asking me to wait outside why are you asking me to prove myself shouldn’t you just be loving me and just let me in? We should bear in mind at this stage when the Gibeonites also tricked Joshua.
The head here can be seen as either the head of the Roman Catholic Church who originally started your group and the apostolic ministry of the head of the Methodist Church also the Protestants. As Joshua was deceived by the Gibionites so too does the Hulk group deceive the restaurant. This deception may be as simple as using Scriptures such as “ love thy brother” thereby laying upon the church a feeling of guilt?
I hear my sister say, that was so dangerous, someone could have been hurt,
The sister represents those who believe in god.
Who is my sister who is my brother but they that do the will of god.
“And I think how it was just Hulk having some rowdy fun”
You have not fully understood who and what the Hulk represents, he represents your group that is the the group that your Methodist church says not to make oaths with secret societies. “ just having fun
Here we see this desecration of the temple as fun.
We must stop and think about hulk, the damage he’s doing to the church and who is actually letting him in? It’s mild mannered Bruce who turns up with his group so innocent looking while waiting in the bistro for the jury to return its verdict. When Bruce realises the verdict may go against him we see his other side emerging as the Hulk, if the group can’t gain entrance lawfully they will quickly resort to force.
When your sister that is the folk from the Methodist church point out how dangerous all this has now become you can’t see it and make light of it?
In light of Hulks behaviour your sister the brethren are alarmed at such behaviour and obviously want to reconsider so they approach you, since you obviously have some say in the matter?
And I consider how I could tell this to her and also realise how she would likely not be amiable to this view.
first you consider telling her, the church, that is to make some excuse for Hulks bad behaviour but then perhaps as you now “realise” it wont work because of Hulks public display of mockery towards the church he has revealed his true nature.",28-05-2021 11:38,526,1214

“Then a waiter appears at our table to tell us the restaurant is ready for us.
The waiter here is obviously Christ himself?
He mysteriously appears to show both groups how to sort out the problem by a very simple method.
We notice the allusion to the bible that Christ will appear to those who seek him with all their heart.
He motions for your group to get ready to prove we’re ready for them?
This getting ready may be seen by you dressing in the same attire as Christ, that is possibly the attire of the waiter, although not mentioned in your dream a quick google tells me the front waiter for a restaurant is dressed in a black suit and white shirt..
Here we see Christ demonstrating how to select genuine members. He wants your group to be dressed the same as him, that is as a waiter, one who serves other people, all types of other people. He wants to see what’s in your heart whether or not you have a heart for people to serve them?

Then he yells, GO! Like someone getting ready to begin a race.
The life of christians are compared to those who run a race, our life is a race to show that we are worthy of his calling or not?

Your group have graciously been accepted and given the uniform of Christ who is the great servant.
You are dressed as he is the same black suit with a white shirt. What he is wanting you to do is imitate him, He sends you out as sheep, simple servants to serve mankind.
Since you have been looking for him he mysteriously appears to you and you have not understood this appearance because only those who live in the light can recognise himself when he appears.
He comes to you dressed the same hoping that you understand him that he is reaching out to you. Here we fund that your group has already been accepted although you haven’t understood the significance of this acceptance yet.
The waiter here wants you to understand that after you have been accepted we need to serve many people all sorts of people just like you and they all have their own ideas and yet the waiter wants you all now to learn the teachings of Christ!

At last! The news your group has been waiting for, there is finally a “place prepared” note again the allusion to Christ’s words, I go to prepare a place for you.

The restaurant is ready to accomodate all sorts of people from all sorts of life from all nations will I gather them.
Although you have been accepted we still need to show that we are willing to run the race? To prove it! Again another allusion to the bible where we are all told to run the race and work out our own salvation.

Now you are told by the waiter to GO, another allusion to go and bring forth fruit,that is to make disciples in my name.
And teach them to bring forth fruit unto REPENTANCE. this is the very first principle of God and that is why he sent John the Baptist to ask sinners to first REPENT and the be BAPTISED that is then be admitted as members of the restaurant.

Having gathered the fruit it must then be inspected is it giddy sorrow that brings you to the temple or worldly sorrow that causes you think your missing out.?
The fruit must of course be godly that is we must have a genuine desire to to enter the restaurant not a fanciful wish.
We notice at first your group are very willing...
“We immediately pick up the table and run with it.
Look at this scene, 6 men handcuffed to the table and now running with it?
“We’re all dressed in dark suits and white shirts moving quickly, huffing and puffing. You are all dressed the same as Christ, in waiters suits.
Soon, you find this waiting on people is very hard work, huffing and puffing it’s real hard work not what you thought it would be? but there’s a table between you and you’re all bound to it to keep the agreement because the table as the covenant keeps reminding you about it. But as you begin to slow down with the hard work which you hadn’t anticipated the remembrance table begins to change shape to that of a coffin?

This is peculiar indeed, your group just wanted to come inside the restaurant and be with those who frequent the restaurant sit down and make merry and just be accepted like everyone else in the restaurant, you always felt left waiting impatiently in the bistro? Notice again the allusion to how we must wait patiently or the masters return and not grow dry o good works.
Now you find you are told to prove yourselves by keeping the agreement which you are bound to do since you are handcuffed to it by your own words perhaps (oath) a binding agreement that will produce proof and are forced to accept the conditions that you signed up for but clearly did not expect. How wonderfull the master has appeared to you although you don’t recognise him and this is the purpose of the trial that when you are genuine and obedient your eyes will be opened and you will see him as he is. Then you will understand.
This is the predicament your group find yourselves in”

“that this is what we must do to get into this restaurant”
. We must compete to prove that we are worthy.
Compete is an allusion to the bible again where is says that we must STRIVE to enter in through the gate that is STRAIT.
Now this is such a predicament here because the restaurant group cannot force people to keep the covenant and the men’s group having agreed to keep that covenant soon realise they can’t!",28-05-2021 11:38,526,1129
1107,742201794.0,"Here’s my dream from last night and I’ll post my initial take in the comments:

I was with a group of men/new acquaintances (reminded me of a Mardi Gras krew) at a posh modern open air restaurant-like courtyard area, standing at a black bistro height table. All the surrounding buildings and courtyard walls were white. There were six of us and a television on a nearby wall was on and blaring some E-Entertainment type story about Dr Jordan B. Peterson. The TV announcer/host was commenting on “the JBP phenomena sweeping the country” and the voice asking the typical troupes; “Is Peterson misogynistic or not?”

We’re all enjoying light hearted banner and seem to be waiting for a dining table or something.

Suddenly, the HULK rushes up to our table and says “Me just want to bowl!” and pounds the edge of our round table causing a large piece to break off and I notice the table is made of concrete. Then HULK rushes a few yards away, grabs a bowling ball and flings it at some pins and they explode from the force as he nails a strike. I hear my sister say “That was so dangerous, someone could have been hurt.” and I think how it was just HULK having some rowdy fun. And I consider how I could tell her this and also realize how she would likely not be amenable to this view.

Then a waiter appears at our table to tell us the restaurant is ready for us and for us to get ready to prove we’re ready for them and then he yells “Go!” (Like someone shouting to begin a race.) We immediately pickup the table (we’re now handcuffed to it) and begin running with it. We’re all dressed in dark suits and white shirts and moving quickly, huffing and puffing, with the table between us that’s now rectangular, like a casket and I realize this is what we do to get into this restaurant. We must compete to be worthy to gain entrance.

We started in Los Angeles and we’re now in New Orleans and the voice over is saying this is the thing “sweeping the country” as we jog/run along one of the men grabs my right leg and pinches hard saying he’s going to hold on and rest and I say “the hell you are”and knock his hand away and then we have to climb a tall white wall (with a barred window at the top) with the concrete table and get our table/casket over in order to gain entry and we do and we make it and we collapse with our table in an outdoor courtyard as I realize the restaurant and view is exactly like the place we just began.",11-04-2021 15:33,1.0,6,794833000000000.0,100001000000000.0,"4th paragraph
“We started in Los Angeles and now we are in New Orleans and the voice over is saying that this is the thing seeping the country.
Previously the Mardi Gras was the most popular event sweeping the land but now we have the Jordon Peterson
Phenomenon sweeping the land perhaps from LA to NO?
Both groups rely heavily on publicity, both use platforms one group street festivals etc the other uses the internet etc.
Both groups are associated with others..
Your group of 6 the Krewe of Comus a secret order started in 1869 and energised the Mardigras at that time which was originally started 1699 with the help of the Roman Catholic Church. Your secret (black) krewe gave the Mardigras an injection of new life when it was needed. Peterson’s group is has associated itself with morals (wihte) and the church.
Here we see the 2 colours come into play the secret group or represented as black or dark as in not seeing, blind to or unperseptive, while Peterson’s group is represented as the White Groupshown by the good will and morals of the church.
It’s interesting when we compare that Peterson although Moralistic and being accepted by the church and yet is not a committed church goer, he’s not really a Christian, he never really ministers the Gospel and so as you have said the association is “ irregular”
So to is your association “irregular” as you yourself describe since your association with your group like the church group require you to make an oath to your group?
Here we see your problem since the group you are originally associated with forbid the making of oaths it’s secret society’s this is your dilemma.
Mathew 5:34
But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne;
Just as Christ “appeared” to the other group as the waiter he also appears to you you now in a dream..
Acts 2:17
""'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, YOUR OLD MEN WILL DREAM DREAMS.
you am is amazing it’s in very great detail outlying to you your predicament and much much more.

So Christ himself appears to the other group to lead the way and untangle the imaginations of their heart and to you he comes as the Holy Spirit to speak to you in a dream. How wonderfull!

As we run, jog along,
one of the men grabs my right leg,
The right leg here must speak of strength, supporting strength the strength you need to support your body/ group, you have that strength you are strong.

One of the men is pinching your leg with his finger and thumb, he’s tired and needs a rest he pinch’s onto you the strongman he see you are strong in the flesh and this is a critical moment in the game for your group, one part of you exhibit super human strength to keep going while another part of you is struggling with the whole race thing.

pĭnch. Filters. Pinch means to squeeze between two surfaces, such as the thumb and a finger.

grip (something, typically a person's flesh) tightly and sharply between finger and thumb.

move one's finger and thumb apart or bring them together on (a touchscreen) in order to zoom into or out of an image, activate a function, etc.
""to explore in more detail just pinch the screen""

Baseball: a critical point in the game

“and pinch’s hard”
saying he’s going to hold on and rest.
Part of you can easily finish the race but the other part needs you to stop and help him.

and I say “the hell you are”
and knock him his hand away
Interesting reply..
What e see here again with is strongman similar to Hulk is that when he becomes impatient his personality changes.
He’s no longer kind and thoughtful neither is he any longer asserting the quality of the head waiter, he’s forgotten again that the race is not about winning but SERVING.
Not only is he not serving but he goes further now in his zeal to finish the race.
It’s possible Christ in his mercy has been with you in the race to make sure you can finish it. Here again you have not understood that Christ once again “APPEARS” to you as the “HAND” to assist you.

Acts 11:21
New International Version
The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord

2 Peter 3:9
King James Version
9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

Christ as the hand tries to slow you down, your running too fast you’ve missed the idea of running the race, it’s to serve remember,

2 Peter 3:9
9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
But you knock him away with “YOUR HAND”
It’s the same as the world they knock back Jesus even when people try to explain in detail how wonderful he is and how much he cares for them.

and then we have to climb a tall white wall
with a barred window at the top,
The White Wall here is possibly Peterson’s almost insurmountable open air message board, it’s so full of of messages that your group has to climb higher and higher on the White Wall of Church morals to get over it, it’s hard going for you guys huffing and puffing.

we are climbing with the concrete table and we have to get our casket/table over in order to gain entry
and we do, and we make it and we collapse
with our table in an outdoor Courtyard..
Somehow you manage to carry your table/
conditions above the tall White Wall of church morality and when you get to the top you and the table “collapse” over the other side.
By knocking back the HELPING HAND you have missed the entrance to HEAVEN . You may have seen it on your way up but noticing the bars deciding to continued your climb agains morals.
Mal :3:10
New Living Translation
Bring all the tithes into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my Temple. If you do,” says the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, “I WILL OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN FOR YOU” I will pour out a blessing so great you won’t have enough room to take it in! Try it! Put me to the test!

As I realise the restaurant and view is exactly the same as the place we first began from.
Having completed this gruelling race, missing heaven then collapsing down the again into an outdoor courtyard?
Is the he same place as before? You say you started in Los Angeles to finish in New Orleans?
It seems that although you shifted location you end up back in the COURT YARD of public opinion again?

What a m9st detailed and wonderful dream you had.
Surely now you can see that Christ has always been with you! He appears as the servant then the helping hand, he must love you very much to invest so much time and energy into your life.",28-05-2021 11:38,526,1433

I was in my sisters house (which in my dream was my house) and a wolf walked in from a storm outside and I pretended to be asleep in the bed because I was afraid it would kill me. The wolf laid down and slept half on top of me. I remember the feeling of being afraid of the wolf despite it not doing anything threatening. I managed to wiggle my hand free and text my sister that I needed her to come and shoot this wolf. She came and shot the wolf dead.

I can only guess because I don’t know the dynamic but let’s look at a few things that might piece it together for you?
It’s your sisters house the female wolves are what hold the vast family together since there is only one breeding pair.
There’s a storm outside a tumultuous reaction, uproar or controversy.
And from that storm/argument the perhaps disbanded wolf seeks refuge and comfort with you?
You think the wolf wants to kill you?
You know what’s going on because you are awake you only pretend to be asleep Eg not know what’s going on.
You pretend to not know what’s going on because you are afraid. Afraid of what?
From here it’s just a wild guess but is it possible that you somehow had something to do with this storm/ argument going on at your sisters house? You don’t want the injured wolf to know so you pretend you don’t know. You think he’s going to kill you but he’s not he’s looking for comfort for him and you “ he half lays on you”
Again it’s hard to piece together but it seems that you don’t want to be accountable in this matter handing the wolf straight back to your sister this time we see the violent reaction of the storm in the final shooting of the wolf caught between 2 sisters???
I note that it is you that needed her your sister to shoot/ control this wolf?
To shoot can mean to kill or wound
You should be able to work this out from here",28-05-2021 11:38,107,318

She was dressed in a very simple way, her clothes were light blue and pink.
She was a magician. She invited me to join a club she belonged to herself. In this club magicians could meet, talk, spend time together. I was tempted to join, but I was not ready to commit myself, because that would mean I'd have to attend the first meeting immediately, so I just said I would consider it for next time.
She was slightly disappointed.",09-04-2021 03:40,0.0,3,790373000000000.0,100001000000000.0,"The Blonde girl is a magician illusionist, sorcerer, witch, enchanter, charmer, satanist, siren to name but a few.
You say she was cute: attractive in a dainty way, appealing, delightful, charming. Acquired some cute mannerisms etc
The blond girl is in fact a young woman this is what you find appealing, she’s not a Marilyn Monroe neither is she a dumb blonde( as the saying goes) but she is a young woman and innocent and the blonde hair represents her fair skin. To you you have found a woman untarnished by worldly living. She is appealing because with you she will continue to grow untainted such as the many beauties you refer to. These beauties also have many qualities such as shape, colour or form that pleases the senses. Notice your young woman is fair this is what really appeals to you rather than exotic colours etc. You are not so much looking to please the outward senses rather you are looking for inner content and satisfaction. However in this case this young girl is a witch/ magician.
Even the way she is dresses is not loud or outlandish, the colours are there but again they are fair colours again suggesting an innocence “she is dressed in a simple way” there are many meanings for the colours however the simplistic meaning may suggest this simple young woman is thinking of marriage and a family the blue for a boy the pink for a girl if this is the case then marriage and children appeal more to you than temporary relationships.
She was a Magician, as described a witch an illusionist. This sweet young girl is casting her spell over you, beware!
Now that she has got your attention she takes her next step, not to come home and meet the family, no, but to join her club, the Magicians club, it’s here where she wants to marry you in, beware again!
She belonged to this club not just a member but “belonging”sugg
esting something far more eg a generational thing with rules and codes etc, a place to socialise with other like minded people to discuss methods to ply their trade. A place to “meet” this is what she wants a place to meet, a place to join to get her.j
YOU ARE TEMPTED to join. Please note very clearly your dream has turned from appealing to TEMPTATION.
You were not ready because you were not ready to commit. You were tempted to just go there no strings attached. The strings of attachment on the first meeting would obviously mean having your name published in the membership and first of all learning the new magical skills as an induction process of which you probably don’t agree with.
You said you would consider it the next time meaning that the temptation for the young woman is still there, unfortunately you can’t seperate the appealing young woman from the magical witch.
She is a little disappointed meaning she will try again. BEWARE!
Proverbs 7
New International Version
Warning Against the Adulterous Woman
1 My son, keep my words
and store up my commands within you.
2 Keep my commands and you will live;
guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
3 Bind them on your fingers;
write them on the tablet of your heart.
4 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
and to insight, “You are my relative.”
5 They will keep you from the adulterous woman,
from the wayward woman with her seductive words.
6 At the window of my house
I looked down through the lattice.
7 I saw among the simple,
I noticed among the young men,
a youth who had no sense.
8 He was going down the street near her corner,
walking along in the direction of her house
9 at twilight, as the day was fading,
as the dark of night set in.
10 Then out came a woman to meet him,
dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.
11 (She is unruly and defiant,
her feet never stay at home;
12 now in the street, now in the squares,
at every corner she lurks.)
13 She took hold of him and kissed him
and with a brazen face she said:
14 “Today I fulfilled my vows,
and I have food from my fellowship offering at home.
15 So I came out to meet you;
I looked for you and have found you!
16 I have covered my bed
with colored linens from Egypt.
17 I have perfumed my bed
with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
18 Come, let’s drink deeply of love till morning;
let’s enjoy ourselves with love!
19 My husband is not at home;
he has gone on a long journey.
20 He took his purse filled with money
and will not be home till full moon.”
21 With persuasive words she led him astray;
she seduced him with her smooth talk.
22 All at once he followed her
like an ox going to the slaughter,
like a deer[a] stepping into a noose[b]
23 till an arrow pierces his liver,
like a bird darting into a snare,
little knowing it will cost him his life.
24 Now then, my sons, listen to me;
pay attention to what I say.
25 Do not let your heart turn to her ways
or stray into her paths.
26 Many are the victims she has brought down;
her slain are a mighty throng.
27 Her house is a highway to the grave,
leading down to the chambers of death.",28-05-2021 11:39,125,1060

The dreams always occur at night in my current apartment.

I do not know who this man is but did get to peer around the partially opened door and finally catch a glimpse of him.

He is 30-40 years old, ~6'4"" and 230+ pounds.

He is dressed in a dirty blue jumpsuit, the kind that a car mechanic would wear.

He has not said anything and I do not know what he wants.

Once the door closes is when I will usually wake up with my heart pounding, ready to fight, and sometimes sweating.

I used to immediately get up and check the locks in real life, but I do not anymore.

This has been going on for probably close to 2 years but the frequency has been increasing as of late (approximately once every 2 weeks)

When one turns around and maybe open the door to one's shadow, it usually turns out to be much more positive than expected and when integrated it become a strength of ones accepted total character,... well it is certainly not an easy task to accept the shadow as it is all one used to hate and still do at the time of such a dream... a way to jump over the worst would be to meditate on compassion to all the different bad sides this shadow person do represent...and

It usually begins with me hearing a noise and getting out of bed to go inspect what's going on. As I reach to make sure the door is locked is when I realize it is an intruder trying to get in.

At first, all I had to do was double check that the door is locked and the intruder would leave.

But the intruder is becoming bolder and stronger with each occurance.

For instance; the next time the intruder left after I told him that I am prepared to fight.
Then, I had to say that I have a weapon that I'm not afraid to use (I didnt have one though).
Then, I would say that the police were on the phone.

Etc.

This slowly escelated to the point that he started to break the locks and begin to open the door but I'd always be able to force it shut.

But with each occurance he is getting stronger.

Recently, once the dream would begin I would know what was about to happen and would prepare by wedging a 2x4 against the door and a wall. This was able to greatly assist me in the strugle of keeping the door closed for a while; although it was still a hard fought battle that would usually last several minutes.

Last night he broke the 2x4. Seeing the 2x4 break scared me enough to give me a surge of adrenaline that was able to provide me with the strength to force the door closed.

However, I do not know how much longer I can keep the door closed on my own and I am running out of ideas.

You mentioned that you are a left brain thinker. The right brain is associated with exploration of the unknown. It is also associated with negative emotion (like fear). This fires up the amygdala. We get in that fight or flight mode. (Excuse my simplistic rendering of JP’s work). I thought of how artists – especially writers – are associated with that negative emotion – the tortured writer. They are constantly exploring chaos and the unknown. And this process fires up the fear and the amygdala gets enlarged. (That’s my theory after reading JP). Anyway, I was thinking maybe you could approach your dream – the chaos – with more the attitude of exploration and curiosity – rather than fear. Invite it in – in a way that arouses curiosity rather than fear. It is coming through the front door after all. Perhaps your sub conscious is trying to get some important images through to you, with which your left brain is unfamiliar. You might try doing more right brain activities that get it into shape – so to speak. The idea is more about a shift in attitude and how you confront or approach the images in your dreams. The mythological story of the hero is about facing your fears (chaos, the unknown, the dragon) and there you will find your greatest treasure. How can you be the hero? Is there a dragon you are not facing? Is it really a dragon – or just the fear of the unknown? BTW I am a classic right brain thinker – and a writer, so I naturally connect patterns and images. Hope it helps you be the hero in your dreams – and real life.",28-05-2020 11:39,495,344

1235,100000000000000.0,"Have any of you ever tried 5-HTP?

I've been experimenting with it for the probably close to a year by cycling on and off, stacking it with other supplements, varying dosages, etc.

While I haven't noticed a significant difference during the day I have very clearly noticed a difference in regards to my dreams.

Ever since I was little, I usually haven't been able to remember my dreams in the morning. But on the rare occasions that I do it is typically one scene played out that is closely related to some significant event going on in my waking life. The dreams are pretty simple and feel as if they last only a few minutes. I have even experienced having the same dream multiple times for months at a time until I was able to slay the dragon in my waking life that was causing those reoccurring dreams. Usually it is me having a conversation with someone or me performing a simple task. I've always contributed this to my subconscious trying to help me out when I was under a great amount of stress or confused about something important.

However, I have noticed that on days when I take 5-HTP(especially when I take it later in the day), my dreams that night are comprised of multiple very complex scenes and a storyline that can be several days in length. These dreams are also not tightly correlated to present challenges I am going through in real life (like my dreams usually are) but can relate to past experiences and even other things that I haven't quite figured out yet.

My dreams are still fairly realistic in that I'm not able to fly or see things that couldn't happen in real life; but instead of just having a conversation with someone for a few minutes, I am having to work my way through multiple scenarios and make many decisions. They are also always very different from one another and I have not noticed any reoccurring dreams on days when I take 5-HTP, so far. Thus, instead of waking up, being able to remember my dream, and fairly quickly being able to think about what the meaning behind it was; I have to spend several hours if not days thinking about it (which I find enjoyable) but even then I am not always able to figure it out at all.

This could just be a placebo, but I honestly don't think a placebo could get me to go from being able to remember 10% of my dreams to remembering 90% of my dreams.

I have read online that people attribute more vivid dreams while taking 5-HTP to the increase in serotonin that it could cause; but I also have experimented with various similar supplements (and even take Adderall regularly) that also impact serotonin levels and have not noticed any differences in my dreams that compares to what 5-HTP seems to be capable of.

Anyway, just something I find very interesting that I figured I share here and see if others have experienced this too.

I just want to share my niece's dream that she shared with me. So it's about seeing her grandmother (my mother) who recently died. From the specific scene which describes as somewhat a ""rapture"" in the bible, she said she first saw Jesus above and the Virgin Mother, Mary in dark clouds. Then after that, my mother appeared and talked to her, asking her how she is. They talked for awhile, and also asked her how's been doing, and she said she is doing fine. Then for some reason my mother is trying to insert her finger on her mouth. When my niece asked why she is doing that, my mother told her that she just don't want to change her voice, whatever that means. Then she shared something like a message to my niece, that we must all be careful and take extra care for something that might happen in the future. And then a white door appeared with gold embellishments, and large bell rang. When it rang, my mother told her that she must return because Moses is waiting for them. And reminded her again that we must all be careful. Then she woke up.

I'm not sure if this can be related or something, but from all the grandchildren, she was the only one who never got to see my mother during the wake since she just got birth during the time to her third child, wasn't able also to attend the last day at the cremation.

First I will paste those verses from the bible so you may compare.
1 thess 4:13

13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.

16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:

17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be
Here we see a description of the so called rapture from Paul’s letter to the Thessalonians
So far we don’t really see any discrepancies between these verses and your dream, however let’s take a closer look..
The bible scene explains to us that those who have died in Christ go to heaven and at a certain time Christ raises them to life and descends to the earth in this case in the air. From this position he then raises up those on the earth who are alive to meet with them in the air.
So we see a meeting in the air of those who lived and died in Christ and also those who are still alive being raised by Christ .
I will make further comment after about this but first I need to include another scripture
Hebrews 12:1
12 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run(A) with perseverance(B)
the race marked out for us,
These clouds of witness’s are the Old Testament saints who waited patiently for Christ to come so thst he would overcome death for them and release them.

* she said she saw Jesus above and the virgin Mother Mary.
The bible never ever mentions anything about Mary in the clouds with Jesus nor does Mary overcome the last enemy which is death neither does Mary have anything to do with raising the dead . This all comes from false religion.

*In dark clouds
Notice again the Dark clouds!
The clouds described in the bible are believers who died in faith waiting for Christ to come and overcome death to set them free. These are faithful witness,s believers who are raised up again. Now who then are these dark clouds by comparison? Of course they are the dark angels the false wittness’s the unbelievers.
Believers of pagan religion.
Notice that This false Mary is in the Dark Clouds herself she is surrounded
by dark angels false witness’s the false religion.
*after that my mother appeared
The appearing here should refer to the appearing of Christ as for those believers who have been told that if we diligently seek him we will find him therefore it is Christ who appears not your mother.
Notice the subtle twist of scripture since his appearance is to raise up his army for the heavenly battle where the dark angels are to be cast out of heaven.
*my mother appeared and talked to her that is your niece.
The rapture scene in the bible is about Christ rising up his armies from the living and the dead to do battle in heaven it’s not for a casual parlay of how you doing?
*look at this conversation
“asking how she is”
“How are you doing”
“I’m doing fine”
This at first looks like a friendly meeting between Mary and your niece but it’s a meeting of deception as I will soon point out for you. There is no such discourse in scripture such as this which conveys the rapture meeting in the air this conversation is completely out of biblical context.
* then for some reason my mother is trying to insert her finger on her mouth???
Please note the direct reference to the finger on the mouth which biblically is well known as the finger of God who writes the laws and the divine scriptures but now we see your your supposed mother placing her own finger over your nieces mouth?
This is very interesting since this mother is basically saying to your niece you should only listen to me your grandmother not the bible !
Here is the deception shown for what it is. Your Mother raised from the dead in a false rapture science by a false Christ Mary who then try’s to stifle your Bruce’s knowledge of the bible by fake visions of dark angels and false Christ’s generated from a false religion.

I just want to share my niece's dream that she shared with me. So it's about seeing her grandmother (my mother) who recently died. From the specific scene which describes as somewhat a ""rapture"" in the bible, she said she first saw Jesus above and the Virgin Mother, Mary in dark clouds. Then after that, my mother appeared and talked to her, asking her how she is. They talked for awhile, and also asked her how's been doing, and she said she is doing fine. Then for some reason my mother is trying to insert her finger on her mouth. When my niece asked why she is doing that, my mother told her that she just don't want to change her voice, whatever that means. Then she shared something like a message to my niece, that we must all be careful and take extra care for something that might happen in the future. And then a white door appeared with gold embellishments, and large bell rang. When it rang, my mother told her that she must return because Moses is waiting for them. And reminded her again that we must all be careful. Then she woke up.

I would love to hear your thoughts on what could this dream is trying to communicate to my niece, or to our family. When I asked her what she felt during her dream, she said she was happy that she got to saw her grandmother. I'm not sure if this can be related or something, but from all the grandchildren, she was the only one who never got to see my mother during the wake since she just got birth during the time to her third child, wasn't able also to attend the last day at the cremation.

Thank you in advance to all who will be sharing their thoughts 😊",15-03-2021 11:01,0.0,5,776779000000000.0,100001000000000.0,"* “when I asked my mother why is she doing that? My mother told her she just don’t want to change her voice? Whatever that means??”
What it actually means is that I suspect your niece has a healthy understanding of god and the bible but here we see a full blown attempt to pervert your nieces understanding with false dreams.
The finger attempts to stifle your nieces voice that is don’t start talking about what the bible actually says but only talk about your family religion.
*then she shared something like a message to my niece”
That we must all be carefull and take extra care for something that might happen in the future”
Ok, what is the message,
This again is a false message, the mother here is putting this religious rapture way into the future out of reach which will have the effect upon your niece of not to worry about it so much! This is a bad attempt to take your niece off guard. Attempting to stop her vigilance of bible reading.
Be careful be extra careful, what, be careful to not read the bible be careful to listen to dark and fallen angels I don’t think so!
At the biblical stage of the rapture we are all told to look for him that is Christ NOW! Look for him now and we will find him now and as we start to find him he starts to appear to us .

This is an allusion to the great white throne judgement nothing to do with the biblical rapture at all since biblical rapture is about raising the armies of the lord to cast out the dark angels now inhabiting the heavens.
* a large bell rang”
False again the bells of the bible are the sound of the gospel being preached through the whole earth to INVITE all to receive salvation. Now it is the TRUMPET that sounds here but it’s sound is a war cry to raise the army to battle not babes in Christ but those who are mature soldiers ready for the battle
1 Thessalonians 4:16, NIV: ""For the LORD HIMSELF will come down from heaven, with a LOUD COMMAND with the VOICE OF THE ARCHANGEL and with the TRUMPET CALL of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.""
the BELL is the preaching of the good news
The TRUMPET is the call to battle
Notice the deceptions here.
NOTE whose voice is speaking it’s the archangels voice not the voice of another.
John 10:27
As I said to you, my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.

* “ she must return for Moses is waiting for them”
Once Christ raises his army from the living and the dead there is no returning this is ludicrous the army’s are raised and go directly into the battle.
I am very sorry to tell you that this dream is formulated from worldly religion as well it is an assault upon your niece you seems to have a healthy understanding of reading the bible all on her own this is why there is an attempt to divert her thinking.
Note: many times I have tried to explain on this site that dreams also come from ourselves as a regulating healthy function but also from God and also from Demonic activity and here is an example of dreams from dark angels beware.
Notice also it is with the voice of the ARCHANGEL not the voice of another person.",28-05-2021 11:40,357,382

Hello all,

I got a recommendation for this group after posting this dream I had in another Jordan Peterson related group:
A few days ago I had a dream/nightmare. I want to share it with you and hopefully get some ideas as to what it might mean. The reason I feel it’s appropriate to post here is that I really would like Jordan Peterson’s take on it. He talks a lot about Jung and archetypes - although I haven’t read extensively on the subject I am very interested in the ideas and I think my dream has some connection to one’s shadow. Also Peterson has talked a lot about dreams and what they might be trying to communicate.
To give you an idea right away, it was a nightmare BUT I was the villain.
Most times when I have a nightmare I am running away from evil, or in some other way trying to escape evil. This time I was evil running away from heroes.
The dream:
I'm driving a car in a world I am familiar with, it's a video game world, more specifically the Grand Theft Auto world. (I’ve never really played the game by the way, IF I played it, my time was spent driving around legally, not even speeding. So it’s safe to say I haven’t really played it)
I realize the cops are chasing me, no small amount of cops, cars and policemen on foot. I'm an evil man (woman in real life btw which is interesting as well), a criminal. I drive fast and recklessly and I’m running through several doors, up and down stairs….
Soon I've gotten rid of the cops, they're not after me anymore. I'm in an empty house that’s still being built, it’s basically still just an iron structure (similar to the one in The Dark Knight when Batman and Joker battle)…
I'm not alone, Aragorn (Lord of the Rings) is there fighting me and he has a sword, I also have a sword. We are hanging on iron pillars and fencing. I get a hold of his sword and I kick him off the building, I watch him fall while I hang there.
When he hits the ground I look up at the building, there I see millions of faces / heads on the building - like manikin heads.
I instantly know it’s me, my face, but instead of it being my own real life face, I'm the Joker (Joker 2020 version) with a disgusting grin on its face. (I loved the Joker 2020 movie btw).
I wake up and I do not want to fall asleep again, I escaped, I won, but I'm evil.
I have the same feeling as when I have a nightmare where something evil is chasing me. Usually when I have a nightmare I wake up right before someone catches me, or something bad is just about to happen. But now I ""won"" and THEN I woke up.
I found it incredibly interesting to dream that I was the ""bad guy"". I've never experienced this before.
I am actually very excited about this and really want to know what it might mean. Obviously the explanation lies in details of my life which I will have to dig into to realise exactly what this means, BUT what I wanted to do was to post this here and get a more general discussion going about what it means when you dream that you’re the “bad guy”.",14-03-2021 15:17,1.0,9,775722000000000.0,100001000000000.0,"You are not the villain! However your dream is simply giving you a view of what might be going on within you at this time.
I’m not qualified to interpret dreams but let’s have a look anyway?
You say it’s a nightmare for you and right from the start we understand that your dream is giving you a glimpse into what you normally wouldn’t perceive since the suggestion is this part of your life is in darkness but what is now revealed by your dream at first seems frightening simply because you previously could not see/perceive it.
Before we start it would be helpful to understand from my perspective that we all experience inner conflict, the bible puts it like this..
Rom:7:23
New International Version
but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.
Look at this, another law, another way, waging war against you waging war against your mind with the purpose of taking you captive. This happens to us all through temptation to various things which we should know better.
Looking at your dream again we see your villain is running away from the heroes, he’s been caught out now whereas before he/she was lurking in the unseen darkness gently deceiving you at first but now your dream has exposed the villain within and he’s on the run, he wants to hide from all this light you are subjecting him to, but he can’t because you’ve reached a point where you are determined to chase down this villain. So on one hand your villain is become exposed on the other hand you are not comfortable at realising there is actually a villain lurking within whose purpose is to bring you into captivity and steal your vehicle. Now you realise that you must actively engage to take this villain into your captivity, reign him in!
Look..
2 Corin 10:
We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
This is what we need to do.
“I’m driving a car in a world I’m familiar with”
The car here is probably your outward every Day body/vehicle and you are a driven type of person seems obvious. You have the drive to go forward in your immediate world whatever that is eg business/ sports whatever? You are driven!
In your dream your world identifies with grand theft auto? From memory elite vehicles have been shopped and stolen for a specific customer who really likes and want that style of vehicle, they are willing to pay for it.
Here’s the thing, it does seem like you are an elite person of sorts your vehicle holds a special place of interest designed to move fast in the company of elite vehicles similar to yourself. You have perfected the design and you are now sought after by others within your familiar life. But now we see the villain entering in to steal away your vehicle just like in grand theft auto where the owner has perfected his ability to design his life the way he wants and make his vehicle streamlined to suit his own particular purpose only to find to his dismay the villain the thief who has done no such work but simply comes along to steal your car, your streamlined vehicle that was designed by you to suit a specific purpose.
So now we can see you as the hero and the villain, the hero as one who puts in all the design work and produces a streamlined vehicle and you also as the villain want into to steal the car away simply to sell it to the highest bidder (grand theft auto)
You are perhaps young and don’t understand this concept, your streamlined vehicle was made that way by vigilant had work according to the law of your mind. The villain is the thief who see’s the beautiful vehicle and has done nothing to make it great and elite and simply steals it from you, look at the villain here..
John 10:10
New International Version
The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
So far your dream is showing you to take good care of the vehicle you have produced because the thief is always looking to steal it from you.
You are not the thief as you so describe yourself “ you do not normally speed etc because you are a careful and thoughtful and you don’t break the law you are not not reckless with your vehicle, each of us need to at some time need to contend. with this situation because we are so given to conditioning ourselves we don’t notice other thoughts creeping in, and this I bother thief creeps into your life, while you are busy conditioning yourself you don’t notice him gradually sneaking in.By stealing your vehicle (GTA) he will only destroy what you have created. Here we see your villain warring against your good mind trying to derail you and eventually sell your vehicle for gain rather than use it for what you originally designed it for.

You are not a criminal you are not reckless but now the criminal within you must remember does not live by the same laws as you live by, remember he is lurking in the darkness and warring against your good mind and he’s waiting for an opportunity to steal your good work.
Your villain is criminally minded that is he breaks all the good laws that you abide by. He manages to elude you through doors and up and down stairs.. perhaps the doors he runs to escape are doors you unwitting opened and now he is using them to escape from you.the stairs you climbed the highs and the lows you’ve battled through he is now using them to his advantage.

Look..
Jer 17:9
New International Version
The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?
Sometimes we only manage to outsmart ourselves.
This part of your dream seems different, also perhaps a different time frame.
A half built house built of iron. Perhaps you are young and still growing, the framework is young, new and strong while still being developed? Notice we have to hero, Batman and the villain, the joker
Here we can see in more detail your 2 sides the hero well developed and streamlined one who fights for good while at the same time we see also your villain in the light, he’s the Joker who opposes the the hero. Notice it starts with oh it’s just a joke nothing serious but in fact he’s warring against your mind but you are young and strong well able to take him on in this iron structure.in fact you identify with this villain “I love the joker” here it comes you love him you identify with him this one who lurks in the dark the villain you don’t really know. But there’s something about him you identify with that lets him in you give ground to him the door is open to the character it’s modern it’s exciting it’s dark but at the end he’s opposing your heroic side, at first it’s fun but now you realise it’s more than that it’s a battle of the mind.
So here you are your two characters, the hero and the villain facing off to Aragorn Lord of the rings who controls the minds of al, you see in his temple. To really win this battle you first need to be know how to overcome the Joker within just as Batman does and then you you can finally take full mastery over Aragon.
You both have swords Spiritual weapons look..
Ephesians 6:17
New International Version
Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
You both have spiritual weaponss to fight with but you win the fight with your powerful word your sword of faith. You watch Aragon th one who controls the minds of millions, he falls to th ground that is he falls from his seat of power he has been dethroned you have cast him down an now as you look up you see the faces the minds of millions of others just like you ready to be set free from this mind game that enslaves them.
Look again.. it’s the word of god that empowers you .
He’s 4:12
New International Version
For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
Notice just how powerful your spiritual words of God really are,",28-05-2021 11:40,695,560

I found it incredibly interesting to dream that I was the ""bad guy"". I've never experienced this before.
I am actually very excited about this and really want to know what it might mean. Obviously the explanation lies in details of my life which I will have to dig into to realise exactly what this means, BUT what I wanted to do was to post this here and get a more general discussion going about what it means when you dream that you’re the “bad guy”.",14-03-2021 15:17,1.0,9,776353000000000.0,780839497.0,"Hmm - with it being a battle with Aragorn vs you the ""bad guy"" I'm wondering if it's reflecting an inward structural/

1288,100007000000000.0,"Let me write this down before the memory is gone. I fought a dragon to save my father [eyebrows raise in armchairs all over the world].

It was no noble movie dragon, but a black fetid and slimy wyrm. I knew things weren't right when through my window I saw the CN Tower had been erected in Montreal (Canadian dreams, eh?) and my first thought was 'the bomb is about to drop'. But as I fled the house, there it was, stuck on the roof like a fly on shit. I knew I wasn't safe in the open, so I tried to scare it away by shouting and throwing rocks. This only got its attention. The beast took to the air and swooped down at me. I was holding only a knife in my left hand, and as I barred the entry to my (late) father's house I tried to slash at the massive head pushing its way through the door. Luckily the skin was soft, not scaly, but still I could not do more than make it angry.

When it finally forced its way in, what followed was a blur. For a few moments I tried to face it head on, taking advantage of the narrow hallway that slowed its penetration into my sanctum, but it was only a matter of time before it reached my father's room. I cannot recount all the details, you know how dreams go, but in a final desperate act I ducked into the bathroom and hid behind the door. As the dragon pushed his head into the tiny room I took advantage of the angle to thrust the knife under its chin and tore along the throat spilling so much black blood and offal that it threatened to drown me in dragon slag. I immediately awoke feeling like a goddamn hero, and here we are, back in at least some kind of normalcy.

I felt a deep biological undertone to the dream, the dragon pushing its way through the bowels of the house like excrement. A seasoned psychoanalyst would no doubt try to make this about latent homosexuality, and perhaps archetypically speaking it is so, but please save me the sermon this engenders, unless it's for the lulz. In my estimation this was a confrontation with the death of my father, and there is a certain similarity between defecation and the passage of dark memories through the noodlature of the brain and into the light where they can be faced. It was equally a struggle to take on my father's mantle and become the father.

Please, chip in with your two cents. I'm interested to hear the reactions. Mostly I'm just writing this to brag that I'm a hero in the most classical sense, at least archetypically speaking. I also thought community might get a kick out of it.",07-03-2021 15:48,3.0,5,773527000000000.0,100001000000000.0,"This doesn’t sound like the story of a hero who slays the Dagon. There’s no hero and no genuine fire breathing dragon, just a slimy oversized worm fleshy with no snorts of fire, the boy also does not slay the dragon with a magnificent sword alas only a knife to slice the putrid flesh.
Outside you are concerned about a potential explosion about to happen and as you attempt to flee the impending danger you notice on the inside the putrid slimy worm stuck to the ceiling.
By contrast There is imminent danger outside and imminent danger inside.outside is not safe, inside is not safe.
The fly you mention is not only feeding on poop but also laying it’s eggs on the organic matter. The fly and the poop of course is most unbecoming for you so you try to scare, frighten it of with only rocks and shouting which of course only unsettles it’s feeding/egg laying which off course infuriates this dragon worm.
The CN tower was at one stage the worlds largest tower and now considered one of the 7 wonders of the world by engineers. This tower has continually been outgrown by new buildings and in your dream in danger Of a bomb to explode it.the bomb may represent the explosion of higher towers surrounding it making it in danger of not being able to utilise its communication antennae?
Perhaps this magnificent building represents your father?
Your building by comparison is in danger of being outgrown or rather ingrown with your dragon worm breeding itself within your tower threatening to make you also obsolete.you see and understand the impending doom confronting the CN Tower outside facing the explosion of surrounding growth and now you are beginning to understand the imminent danger of the breeding dragon worms within your building. Your dragon worm has already grown to the point that your normal tactics of hurling small hurling small stones aren’t really working anymore frightening it by shouting also proves ineffective? Now you are forced to go one better, the knife with a keen cutting edge perhaps the tongue is used to slice strips off your Dragon worm. You barre entry to your late fathers house knowing perhaps that you don’t stand a chance if the 2 were to team up against you. Her we see a war of words and arguments your tongue etc used as a knife and you holding your knife under your fathers chin and when you succeed to make the cut all the bad blood between you both are exposed and you are covered in the slag drowning in it. You yourself speak of a confrontation and this seems true but now we see details of bad blood between the 2 of you the small rocks the shouting the piecing knife like tongue. This dragon is dead but it lives in filth somewhere in your soul. You mention the dark memories, memories which attempt to revive the dragon and stir up the old arguments. Not only did you fight with your father but you say yourself that it’s also difficult to take on his mantle which is a problem in addition to the bad blood between the 2 of you. Notice the CN building how it’s communication was outgrown by taller buildings so your communication in danger of exploding as the dragon kept getting bigger and bigger and now beginning to fester.
My 2 cents.. on your part there is a lot of humility and grace required to forgive your father. We see this requirement from your own words.”I,m a hero and I,m writing this to brag”

Note: the way to clean the bad blood..

The soul is in a fallen condition to which Jung persistently tries with no avail to ressurect, to do this he must travel backwards to the state of mans beginning and then his fallen state which can only be redeemed by God and his Son Jesus. Someone please tell Jung that Jesus is the way the truth and the life.
The spirit of man is Born again when the correct conditions are met eg godly repentance not Psychology. Here in lies the fault. Man pursues an outdated soul with knowledge that he was told not to use. The new man is born of Gods power alone not mans power. This is the big difference and the big fault that causes man to loose his way without God.
Jungs way is a backward approach trying ever so hard to lock the secrets of God without meeting the required conditions. Therefore Jung cannot be born again he can only congregate with all the other fallen Gods .eg
Ephesians 6:12
For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood
enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.

Here it’s possible to understand that these fallen Gods actually hold positions of power in heavenly places.
This is what is not understood by our genius’s. When they start tapping into this power they have rejected god and because they have rejected God they cannot be born again spiritually they only remain in the fallen state of fallen men and fallen angels.",28-05-2021 11:42,138,304

In the gospel of Thomas and also of Mary he zooms in on both male and female aspects of observation in relation to Marys question on how shes able to see Him in a vision when he had been put to death. And he explains to her how the mind and collective unconscious works and how she is able to see him.

Thats mindf number 1.

Then you get to our interpretation of Christianity. We apply as corrupt fear filled people the misplaced salvation of man as an excuse to justify his murder. But Jesus whas put to death after a puppet trial for opposing the Sanhedrin and describing the temple as corrupt and obscene. The hard truth is that man is afraid and therefore corrupt.

That brings us to mindf 2. Have we eradicated true Christianity in order to replace the truth with a more palatable view of our own archetypes? I would say that the precept you submitted with the question alligns well with that and that you are probably correct.

But I dont think psychology describes Jesus. I think Jesus was far more ahead than mans view of psychology will ever be. Man or God, I think Jesus was a lot smarter than CG Jung.

Having her stand there is making me uneasy, funnily enough. She doesn't look scary or anything, though. There is some sense that I can choose to acknowledge her presence or not - as if her presence is only a suggestion.
I choose to do so, and I ask her who she is. She simply lifts her arm and points her finger at me. At this point I immediately think to ask if she is my Anima, and so I do. She says no, however, but for some reason I don't quite believe her. She might be telling the truth, though - i couldn't say.

I think I went on to ask her some other questions as well, but I don't really remember any more. One of them might have been 'what are you doing here', to which I recall no answer. I'm not sure how you might even have answered that question though, seeing as it would make sense for her to be there, if she is really a part of me, just the same way it makes sense for me to be there.

Can anybody shed any light on any of this? :)",13-02-2021 20:16,1.0,4,763117000000000.0,100001000000000.0,"2 scenes, you are sitting on the toilet, she is standing in front of the shower.
These 2 scenes are comparable and have an order about them.
Eg: when one first goes to the bathroom the order is firstly the toilet then the washbasin or in this case the shower.
As you are in the sitting position to relieve yourself of old material the young girl also is now in a standing position to relieve herself of old material being the old dress.
Your old material needs to go her old material needs to go, she wants a new dress because she’s growing up.
She answered your question truthfully,
“You are you my anima”
She truthfully says no because you just grew out of her, and in fact she is out of you, she stands ready for the next stage of her development in your life as someone else perhaps no longer a girl with an old outdated dress but beginning now as a new young woman wanting to undergo a shower and and change into a new dress more appropriate with your new growth.",28-05-2021 11:43,331,202

You are concerned about marriage?

The mother is obviously in charge of preparation for a wedding. This matriarch woman is the head of the family and she is the one in control of the wedding prep.
She is prepared but you are not prepared.
She is in the kitchen doing her part for her guests while you are stewing away in the fire.
She is strong and experienced you are young and nervous (I don’t know)
She finds herself in the kitchen which is the correct place to prepare but you find yourself in the wood oven as providing fuel for the wedding preparation fuel for the wedding food and guests.
You are completely out if your league here she’s got it all covered.
She’s not cooking you she’s in fact using you for fuel for the cooking. Without you there will be no fire, no wedding.
No food, no preparation.
It’s more abou her than you.
The puppy is not dead but severely burned.
the puppy has blue eyes it’s sort of innocent but young and innocent. And turns to YOU. You don’t know what to do? The puppy wants you to understand that he is getting burnt to a crisp herE and feeling THE HEAT of the whole thing.
Unfortunately you shut the door on it, it’s not your place to say anything about the whole arrangement at all. The wedding prep belongs to the mother and is more important than the feelings of this little pup, it’s not your place to speak up during the preparations because it’s the mother/ mother in laws place to speak up not yours.
You still don’t know what to do, you can’t determine wether to kill this all off or go through with it. But youre still inquisitive you want to know who is making you feel nervous about all this who is putting you under pressure who is in charge of all this? Why of course it’sthe matriarch just ask her daughter your soon to be wife? She’s of course happy about everything but you’re not?
Now you know who arranged the wedding prep and perhaps the wedding matchmaking?
She’s done her job well, what did you expect?
You are the puppy and your fiancé is probably the 12 year old girl?
Notice the girl is cheerily informing you? She’s definitely happy with the way her mother is preparing everything, why would you think otherwise?
In the mothers eyes you two adults are still little babies not knowing much at all. {I don’t know what to do) you ask the young girl but you’re not going to get our answer there because she obviously agrees with her mother.
The mother is at the sink!
You are in the fire!

conscious mind.

Waking slowly, without turning your mind to anything in particular in the outward world, and perhaps towards the inwardly directed question 'did I dream', might help.

I believe some vitamins are known to boost memory of dreams, too.

Naps of a couple of hours often bring dreams into awareness on waking. An absolutely terrible sleep pattern is the best, I find, but I wouldn't recommend it.

I wouldn't worry about the dream, since that would rely on a particular confidence in it's interpretation,
there's little chance of pinning one down just on that detail alone. The fact that it did come into conscious awareness, and was emotional is just nature doing it's thing, making the unconscious conscious. Whatever it means, I'd consider it a healthy expression of something needing to come up and be expressed.

There is a passage from Jung that comes to mind, as an example of how the seemingly negative can be positive in dreams, ""from the symbolic tone of death, arises the symbolic tone of rebirth.""

It could, despite appearances, equally be a behaviour leading to something positive, not only negative.",28-05-2021 11:43,117,246

In not entirely sure of the order of events...

I was in a dim indoor setting, with Indian decor. An Indian woman in traditional clothing was beside me. She held a candle and placed it on a table nearby. She handed me a candle, but I think I struggled a little to place it where I intended, on the table, she may have then handed me another, repeating this part... I moved into a side corridor, and a moment later, I was looking down from above at a small seeming elephant. There was another creature, almost as large, the elephant was over the top of it. The other creature was strange, it was white and appeared to have several legs, which were like large white upturned claws, like a huge claw-legged spider type creature on its back. The elephant stood over it, and crouched down with the other creature beneath it, as though it were gathering it, hugging it, enclosing it, bound within it's four legs. I saw a couple of the white claws that had found a gap between the elephants legs, and were extending reaching out and around the elephants back, the rest of the white clawed creature was obscured underneath the elephants body, with the elephants 4 legs confining the creature between them. Though the claws of the creature looked dangerous, it didn't harm the elephant. As the elephant then walked away, a few small illuminated spots of neon colour glowed briefly on the elephants body, as though the elephant had attained some special quality by doing so. I was then at ground level looking toward the now large elephant walking towards me, slightly worried for a moment, then not, I realised the elephant wasn't a threat to me.",27-01-2021 21:04,1.0,7,760336000000000.0,1429196185.0,".. the candles - looking for enlightenment..

1483,1057890534.0,"Alright here’s a super strange one! Overall I only have wild, violent dreams and stopped dreaming for years until I read Alchemy: an introduction to the symbolism and psychology. I often feel I’m half awake and just following the journey and don’t wake up anxious or stressed, usually just super weirded out.

I was in a huge house with a bunch of friends, some of whom I recognized. It was pretty obvious that we were there to party and it seemed like a cabin in the woods. At one point, we talk about going onto the roof and the staircase is a spiral going up at least 10 floors on the outside. One of the women seems to speed up it like sonic the hedgehog in front of me.

On the roof, it’s obvious we are in a mountain town and it’s lit with string lights and super pretty. An old man comes up from what seems to be a ladder on the side of the building on the other side from us and he motions to us saying something like, hey is this yours? He seems like a grounds keeper or building manager. We walk over and there’s a few benches with towels and unwrapped (but really neatly laid) condoms on them. I said something like “no, that must have been the people here before us?” And I had this grossed out feeling.

He acts a bit funny about it, seems to be mad at us and then leaves. We keep talking and then he appears again right in front of us coming over onto the roof but this time he seems like he’s turned into an alien with a squid-like face. One of the guy leans down towards him and all of a sudden I become the alien and I shoot my tentacles at his mouth, punch a hole I. The back of his head and rip his mouth off to where there’s just a gaping black hole where it used to be but no blood.

Clue 1. A Dream about a ghost hand lifting me up and pulling me this way and that... which I looked up to mean something like transformation.
Dream 2. Old friends from primary school... which to me means an easier time in life but more specifically a time when I relaxed more, was present more, felt more and in general my brain experienced the stress of life and responsibility less.
Dream 3. Having a fight with my dad when he pulls a police baton on me but I materialise a katana and cut him in half first (he doesn't die btw he just says ""Hey I was gonna do that first!"" And we go back to being mates)... something along the lines of My Dad to me is Expectation, responsibility, perfection and hard work... a katana is a straight cutting weapon and a police baton of all things is a melee weapon.

By the time I was 8 I had had many night terror dreams. Crabs, spiders and the like covering my walls, and then something completely different.
I was sitting on the floor with my knees held close to my chest by my arms in a corner with a wall to my right and one behind me. The floor and walls were white and so tall I could not see the top and there was no roof but the walls slowly faded into a pale blue sky, I was definitely outside. There was a third wall about 100 feet or so to my left parallel to the wall on my right. Both of the walls extended beyond the horizon and I was aware of the curvature of the floor, that all produced the effect of sitting on a huge globe in a wide hallway. In the distance, I could barely see, large white blocks like giant marshmallows (I believed them to be hard as stone) were appearing in the hall. The hall was about 5 blocks wide so 20 feet by 20 feet and only filled from my right to left. Each subsequent dream more would appear and over 30 years and a hundred or so dreams the hall slowly filled.
Then when I was about 40. The blocks reached me. The block in front of me was 20feet away. Then each of the 4 to my left (they changed direction on the last row) appeared leaving only just enough room for me to fit. I looked at the two blocks I could see and thought ‘what now’ at which point the blocks disappeared very rapidly in the reverse order that they appeared in.

I was walking down a well worn road in the forest with a preacher I had frequently listened to in my youth.(was formerly very religious) The man was passionately defending the sincerity of his religious convictions in light of adopting more progressive religious views(theistic evolution).

You used to walk down this path of the gospel well worn by all the saints previously.it is more than likely you who is the one who was passionate, sincere and defended the gospel?
“in light of more progressive theistic views”
This is probably the way you were growing in Christ, notice you now both sit on top of the boulder? This is the rock Christ Jesus you are seated in him and he was your light and everything you learned you learned in him?
We notice the disagreement here as the 2 of you talk it out on the Rock. The disagreement is obviously that you are walking your own path and not the well worn path of the saints.
Come let us reason together as men.And now we notice you begin to “slip” off the “Rock” you grabbed him, him, who did not want to be rescued? You did not at that time want Christ to save you, you like job have heard of him by the hearing of the ear but your eye has not yet perceived the true saving grace that you need in Christ the rock. You had this grace freely given but at that time did not truly understand the power of the gospel you understood at that time learning upon learning. But not his sacrifice nor his saving grace.indeed you did “ not want to be rescued”
We see that the man was grabbed on his way down this was Christ reaching out to him in love but still he “fell “right off the side of the Rock.
You want to “check” on him, your conscious is now starting to work but first you want to check on your mother who is comatose that is unable to help in this situation but she is to your as moss in the side of the rock!
The symbolic meaning of moss is charity and maternal this is the nature of the church but in your eyes has become comatose and even dirty?

“What does Moss symbolize?
Moss is an interesting plant that when people are trying to associated plants, flowers, and arrangements, they would probably never think about it. Moss even has a floral meaning of charity and maternal love, so this can be a great addition to what you are creating and a great plant to have.
When you walked the path you took your mother for granted but now you want to check 8; with her and as the man looses his grip and completely falls away from the Rock so too does your mother seen by you as a pile of Dirty moss. You call and cal but receive no answer such as in the book of Solomon she calls to her beloved but where has he gone not realising that it is she who must make herself ready for him when he calls to her.No longer do you see her beauty no longer do you sit on the rock and aspire greatness in Christ neither di you understand the great love and mystery of Christ and his beautiful church your father and Mother? now you wake up? And again as Job perceived now I have seen him with the seeing if my eye, now Christ in his loving grace can reveal to the mystery hidden from ages that is the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory",28-05-2021 11:45,256,620

In The Bible there's of course the tree of knowledge and the tree of life. The fungus makes one trip but not without the essence of one of these trees, transporting its fluids to the fungus and from there to animals and humans.

Could be you witnessed an evolutionary process?

The fungus needs a host, has deep roots and also widespread. It's an information network.
The knowledge of the tree can only be transferred through the fungus. Animals and humans get the opportunity to learn this knowledge and integrate it in their being and lives.

Sonu Shamdasani, the editor and one of the translators of Jung's Red Book and The Black Books, said that 'Thus Spoke Philemon' could have been a mimetically conceivable title of Jung's Liber Novus (The Red Book). This illustrates the close affinity of Jung's work with that of Nietzsche's, especially the 'visionary' work in Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

3 characters: me, older brother, malevolent murderer person

I am a truck driver. So I was driving down the road and my brother was riding along in the passenger seat. He was trying to distract me and cover my eyes from seeing something as I was driving down the road. The scene transitions into a countryside property in someone’s yard. Me and my brother were running from a being, a person. I could feel a strong malevolent presence in what was chasing me. At this point the person I was running with was my brother but I was never able to make that distinction. So we are running around this pile of split firewood, or a pile of something, and this malevolent force is closing in fast. It’s right behind me. I stop running but I don’t turn around to look at what’s chasing me. I can’t tell if my brother has escaped or is present. Or if he’s the one behind me. I hear a revolver hammer cock back. Bang. I fall down on the ground and my vision goes blurry like tv static. I don’t feel pain. Suddenly like you stand up too fast and the feeling of blood rushing up to you head is what I feel. I mutter some lines like “if there’s any sins I haven’t atoned for please forgive me” but I knew my life had to speak for itself at this point.

Recently in real life I stayed in a hotel in Miami and last night I had a dream that I was in that same hotel room except I was there with my mother instead of a friend and I realized there was an alligator/crocodile in the room. It was pretty terrifying until I realized if I yelled or bonked him with a pillow he would stand down. This alligator/crocodile may or may not have been wearing an airforce lanyard (?) or stole my airforce lanyard (??)... I’m able to keep him at bay then I eventually get hungry and there are plenty of palm sized apples, the kind you can fresh pick in Maryland and there are also onions, which I was eating like apples (!!!). Eating onions like apples is not something I do personally, but I have a couple of cousins who would when they were kids. I’m about to bring my mom some apples, when I realize, oh god, we’re in my childhood home wtf are we doing here (?) so I ask her if she remembers the alligator/crocodile and she said no and then I said Be careful I think he’s still here. Sure enough, he is, I see him from across the house and I’m not sure if the couch is high enough to protect us, so I decide to strike. I notice he is in my moms room and maybe if I run fast enough I can lock him in. I charge, but I’m too slow and he gets out of the room and I have to scale the hallway, you kno, like when you’re a kid and you climb up door ways by straddling them. So I’m there, suspended in mid air starting to sweat and starting to slip, concerned because at this point I’ve obviously showed fear and now I’m wondering if I can jump on his head..? But what would that do...? I’m touching the ceiling racking my brain for a solution and then get woken up in real life.

For example I had a dream that the brakes were out on my car. My sister asked me the question: what do brakes mean to you? I said they are a safety mechanism to prevent you from crashing and getting hurt. Then she asked what does it mean that they don't work? It means that I am on a path that I cant stop.

So my advice to you is to find out what does an aligator/
crocodile mean to you. Write down as many adjectives as you can about what you think it represents. Then what does it mean to hit something with a pillow. What does it mean to eat an onion instead of an apple? What does your childhood home mean to you? What does it mean to have a crocodile in your childhood home? What does it mean that you are climbing walls? Etc.

of dreams are far less helpful than using your own definition and meaning of the elements of the dream to find its meaning. DM me if you want any further assistance. Good luck!",28-05-2021 11:47,455,225

I had a number of girl friends before my wife. Most of them kind of showed interest in me first and I kind of went along with it. Like I was partly interested but then just wanted to get out.

A year or so before I met my wife I went after a girl and then found out something I didn't know that made me think twice. I thought it over and decided to continue so reached out to her. Things puddled along then fizzled out.
A short while later she approached me to start hanging out again.
I immediately knew what I had to do. I had to say no, because the spark had gone. Conceptually I could see something happen but the little plant had withered and it felt like self respect required me to say no.
I did and I know it was necessary. Somehow, in a way I don't understand, it was a necessary preparation of me for my wife.
Amazingly, she understood and had even had similar experiences to me.

I don't know if this is relevant or helpful but I felt to share the whole thing.

So, background: I've recently been in contact with an ex-girlfriend from more than twenty years ago. We had a bad ending to our relationship (my fault), but she's forgiven me, and we're friends now. We've been in contact quite frequently. I'm learning another language, signed up for a gym; things are improving. I am fairly certain that if I asked her to, she would move here for me. I'm not sure if that's what I want, or if it's wise, but that's my perception of the situation.

Then, last night, I had this dream:

I was at some kind of archeological dig. The man leading the dig had a daughter, a beautiful woman about my age, and after playing hard to get, she decided she really liked me.

Later in the dream, I met another beautiful woman, also my age, who also really liked me. This made the situation difficult, since I had to decide which one to hurt. It wasn't a pleasant choice. In the end, I chose the second woman.

Now, I associate these women with my anima. What does anyone here think about this? Does this indicate some kind of ""split?"" Another detail is that the first woman had dark hair, and the second woman had light hair. Normally, I find dark-haired women more attractive, yet I chose the light-haired one. What do you all think? Why would I have to choose to hurt one? Is this related to my recent re-connection?

But suddenly you feel hot.. this is the relationship warming up again after so long a time. Being hot suggests acting quickly but we notice there is still a little ice left in the well just enough to bring your temperature back down to normal. You were hot for her again but when you looked deeply into the well you used that remaining coldness in the relationship to sober your thinking up to bring back your temperature to normal so you can think straight. Notice that you “doused” yourself with the ice as if to put out that burning fire within. This suggests the fire within is the hot relationship you once had but now gone cold.

You are a new man by the sounds of it, the gym a new language etc but you go backwards now digging deep to find that lost love that you lost with the new found confidence of your new self. You say you had a bad ending which sealed up the old well and it froze over time. You felt guilty she forgives? You are not sure? It’s normal to want to go back in so to speak and want to fix our mistakes this is our humanness but what is the wise thing to do?
You are friends now so perhaps you need to make a decision before it goes further. On one hand you say you are not sure? One the other hand you feel certain she would come to you, if you asked her?
Should you ask her this is the question?
This is in part why you go digging, looking for an answer and that’s when you saw the ice see comments previous post.
You meet 2 women?
The man leading the dig is obviously you looking at the well the old relationship. His daughter with the dark hair is your old relationship it’s in the dark now after so long a time so it’s hard to figure it out again. She plays hard to get but eventually decided that she likes you, but is that enough?
The second woman is probably yourself with the light hair consciously much more aware and confident of yourself than ever before.
It’s interesting that you chose the light haired woman, this is the new woman in your life Eg the gym the new language etc this is the one you chose.
You have to hurt, that is emotional pain which causes growth, one of these women because they both love you but one is not good for your new growth and would inadvertently stop you growing Eg new language, gym membership etc these speak of a man who is growing and looking after himself physically and spiritually. The dark haired woman who you had to dig deep into your past would potentially throw you off track if you chose her?

Both the girls in my view are ways you see romance. They are sequential, and in my view the dream advises that your taste in women will change and that both paths lead to an injury in you.

The well scene Id say is premonition. Its the well or reservoir of the collective unconscious... a premonition possibly to you posting on this site. The chunk of ice is the non growing you... meaning you choose the first girl or first version of you, the unfrozen water becomes the second version of you as it is brought to light. That is the more integrated growing version of you. The world is a cold place, but you find warmth in yourself as you become wise or resonate with the light. I use light as a metaphor in the spiritual sense.

I dont think it has anything to do with the actual girl, other than sparking your introspection. I think it has everything to do with how the girl will change through your perspective should you choose to either change or not. Or put another way. You are a lense that might dig more or not. The outcome is the same either way.. something is gained and something is lost. Same principle applies to you. If you wish to grow the previous you will die. Hope that makes sense. Either path you choose... make sure to involve the actual girl in this journey. Its a dream that is loaded with spiritual growth symbols. If she responds well then great, if not then... sadly same scenario. Sonething is gained and sonething is lost. But you will be warm in the cold, so do not fear it.",28-05-2021 11:47,393,335

First part of the dream I enter a large stone building that is shaped sort of like an igloo. The building is completely empty but inside looks like it used to be a place of worship or church. At the back there’s a stairway leading up to what seemed to be a large wood stove or oven, that hasn’t been used in a while. I walked up the stairs to the stove to find that it had been converted to a shower and immediately felt that I needed to wash myself. I begin to take my clothes off and noticed that clothes from other people had been left behind. I also noticed that the showerhead had started to run and everyone else’s clothes were getting wet. I had no place to put my clothes down because there was water everywhere. In the dream I never did end up showering because the dream shifted to what seemed like a second part...

Part two
Standing there with the water still running, I looked over and saw a television with a show playing. In the show there was a father, a mother, and a young adult son who lived out in the wilderness alone, possibly in some sort of post-apocalyptic situation.￼ The son had down syndrome. He had sunglasses that were broken, but his father was able to fix them for him and he was very appreciative to have his sunglasses back. The family was happy that the father was handy enough to fix the things that were broken in the family. But then the dream shifted to the mother. The family found out that she had a life-threatening condition of some kind, something to do with her brain. Possibly a brain injury of some kind. The father was working on a way to fix her, and his solution involved cutting away her consciousness and transplanting it into himself or some other Avatar so that she could continue living in another being. The son was very concerned about this, but the mother assured him that this was the only way for her to continue existing. The morbid piece was that the father would to have to perform the surgery on her with no sedation due to their circumstances, and the process was going to be torturous and agonizing for her. But she insisted they moved forward anyways. I think she died, but I cannot be sure. The dream ended here.

2002,100003000000000.0,"This goes way beyond simply analyzing archetypal significance of dreams. This is an investigation into precognitive dreams themselves and even branching into the prophetic category.

This could take some time since I’ve had numerous, but the primary reason I’m posting this is to look into the final dream I will describe at the end. Those that precede it are to build the context that dreams that predict the future are something that I’ve become familiar with. Every one of these except the final one were exact play outs down to every discernible fine detail. Only the last description here was symbolically predictive/precognitive. The others were actually exact. When they came to occur years later they followed the dreams to exact details including people I came to meet face to face whom I had no knowledge of as actual people prior to actually meeting them. These were “characters” in my dreams who ended up being actual people who I met years later in the exact circumstances I dreamt of meeting them. One of these dreams was of a night I went ice skating. Im a very skilled skater and I’ve played ice hockey for around 10 or so years. I hadn’t been skating for over 13 years before this day that I invited some friends to go skating. I didn’t expect it to be as crowded as it was, but I have a way of maneuvering through crowds without impeding the paths of others or running into them. Anyway that doesn’t matte to the rink guard who had a problem with my skating style. I ended up getting kicked off because instead of talking to me and letting me know they had rules regarding skating speed when the ice was crowded he would yell at a low volume to slow down. You wouldn’t even necessarily be sure you heard him or what he said and even if you thought you might have heard someone yell slow down it could just be some uptight skater who doesn’t like the idea of you speeding around when they planned for a typical leisurely night of slow skating. I didn’t even realize they had rink guards out and I didn’t hear him except for two times I wondered if maybe I heard some other skater yell “slow down” without even being certain if that’s what I heard. Anyway there was one person there that at the time I dreamt this event I hadn’t even met yet, though it turns out we were already affiliated as facebook friends though we didn’t converse much here and I didn’t even know what he looked like as his profile picture was not of him or his face. Anyway The dream stuck with me in a particular way. In the dream I ended up getting kicked off the ice by a rink guard who looked like a very accurate cross between both Jay and Silent Bob ironically. I even sat at work the next day laughing out loud to myself that the guy in my dream literally looked like an almost exact hybrid of Jay and Silent Bob fuzed into one person so the image stuck with me. There was a little bit of an argument and he was making a big deal about kicking me off for the whole night even though he could have skated up to me at any point especially when he saw me standing on the bench drinking water and taking a break from skating and I observed him staring at me in a strange way. Yet he simply lightly shouted at a volume I could barely notice. When he said he told me to slow down 3 times so I was kicked off for the night I was surprised and tried to get him to understand that I never even knew he asked me to so to me it was the first time and that I agreed not to skate so fast the rest of the night he refused to listen. He seemed to me like someone who wanted to excel as a skater and like he had an underlying personal issue with me so I began to wonder if he was partially jealous of my abilities or something and though I was staying calm and trying to talk things out with him he took on a very aggressive tone. I felt it was unfair as I paid $10 to skate and I was only out there for about 1/3rd the skating time. So I went to get my water bottle and chilled on the bench to see if he would chill out and change his mind as I was explaining to him that he could have just skated over to me and talked to me face to face respectfully instead of yelling and me not even knowing what he said for sure or who even said it. I explained to him that I would have understood and slowed down. He refused to listen so when I got frustrated I inquired that maybe he was jealous. Anyway there were other details. Another rink guard told one of my friends that they couldn’t weigh in on what happened as they were busy fixing a broken door so they didn’t witness what happened and my one friend thought he was saying that I got pissed for getting kicked off the ice so I broke the door. This exact event happened when this night actually happened over 4 years after having the dream. I mean every detail of the night including one of my friends who I did not know at the time of the dream ended up being there exactly as I dreamt it. It was an exact replay of events. I didn’t realize it until after the events transpired as I wouldn’t meet this person for years after the dream so I had forgotten about the dream until the event of the dream actually transpired. At the end of the dream just before I woke up as I was waiting for my friends to finish skating when the public skating session was ending there was a very large heavy set guy in full hockey gear who skated out onto the ice and put a water bottle and some hockey sticks on the bench to get ready for what was either a late night game following public skating or an open hockey session. Anyway he awkwardly skated right at a little girl holding onto the boards to support herself and keep from slipping and falling like he was trying to intimidate her. It was very surreal so I laughed about it as a funny weird dream thing after waking up, but what was even stranger was that this event actually happened years later. It was beyond a vague deja vu sensation. It was exact without question. There are a number of other fine details that were exact, but the basic point is that everything down to my thoughts in the dream were the thoughts I had when the events actually played out. I didn’t have the epiphany that I had dreamt this all before while it was happening, but after the fact I had realization and there was no room for doubt. I could even remember sitting at work over 4 years ago the day after the dream and suddenly smirking and laughing because of the idea that my mind conjured a character that looked like a combination of Jay and Silent Bob. It was even funnier to find out that this guy who kicked me off the ice actually existed and was not simply a character in my dream. I could have had some fun if I realized this and knew what was going to happen before the events took place. If I had however I would have played with the events and had by the very act of remembering and recognizing the dream as precognitive changed the future I had previously predicted. The very act of realizing it would have changed my thoughts about the events which happened to have been predicted exactly in my dream.

Another one was a visit to an aquarium that took the whole night to dream through in exact detail so I won’t even try to elaborate like I did in the ice skating dream. The whole point of detailed elaborations is to emphasize the point that these were not even remotely vague sensations, but definitive factual precognitive events without any doubt. In the aquarium dream I met
a number of people who I would actually meet at the aquarium years later who I did not even know existed as actual people at the time of the dream. I could go into detail though this dream was even more thorough in some ways than the ice skating dream so there’s no point in doing so unless I expect people to be reading for an excessive amount of time. If I can’t explain those details thoroughly then I’m better off putting that criteria aside. I feel I’ve already emphasized well enough that these dreams were exact accounts. Nothing was skipped. There was no unaccounted events in the dream compared to when the events actually took place. I woke up at least 8 times or more that night in the middle of the dream and then went back to sleep picking up in the dream discernibly exactly where I left off each and every time. I think it took the whole night until close to sunrise to complete the dream. I don’t really know if it picked up immediately after falling back asleep or not, but it happened in number of successive stages in exact order. There were 2 others that I recall of events that played out years later exactly as I dreamt them.

Anyway the close I was leading up to here involves a dream that I had over 17 years ago when I was between the years of 10 and 12. This dream unlike the others I described above was not an exact premonition of actual events however. This one was more prophetic and symbolic in the coding of information.

————————————————————————
In this dream I was separated from a laboratory type room that had thick glass observation windows. On the other side of the glass was a rotting decaying corpse zombie type being that had flesh sloughing off it’s bones. It was looking at me and it started spontaneously combusting itself and ignited itself on fire and spewing smoke. There were these fan/exhaust type vents that were sucking in the smoke and venting them into the room I was in and this innate sense filled my mind that was a kind of innate knowing that it was trying to spread a supposed virus “🦠“😉 of some kind to me. It was clear that the being wanted and expected me to be afraid yet there was no trace of fear experienced in this dream by me. It simply wasn’t a scary feeling dream. It was as if I was expected/supposed to be afraid yet I was innately imbued with a sense that there was no real danger and that it was all a kind of illusion/show. I wasn’t falling for it and then the dream ended and I woke up, but upon waking beginning seemingly at the moment I began to open my eyes I was struck by this deeply innate sense that I already knew what this virus was.. more specifically that I was somehow supposed to know already in a matter of fact way like it should have a name I could call it by, but at the same time like it was a question of “what is that virus?” like it ought to have a name as an answer yet somehow as if it didn’t actually exist yet. The feeling struck me in a deep specific way. Like I was just supposed to know, but if I only had the name that was similar to the feeling of looking for word that communicates something you mean to say, yet it’s just on the tip of your tongue. It was somewhat like that feeling, but quite different also. Anyway I thought about it throughout a portion of that day. I even talked about it with my cousin/friend later that day explaining what I just explained about it here. I really would have to emphasize the significance of this feeling to truly get the point across. It was an evident and poignant feeling that was present before my eyes were even open just as I awoke from the dream. It stuck with me throughout the day. One of the significant details was that this virus was apparently something that I was expected to fear yet that I knew posed no actual threat. This question that was present immediately as I awoke from the dream could be paraphrased as “what is that virus?”. So I went on to forget about the dream. Years and years passed. Over 17 in fact and then in the first months of media coverage of the corona virus ““pandemic”” I had this exact dream as a recurring dream. I was the same age in the dream as I as at the time I had it the very first time. Only this time one detail was changed. That question that I woke with before my eyes had even opened now was replaced with n answer and a name for the virus. This time I awoke practically sleep talking in the moment between sleep and waking thinking to myself “that was the corona virus.” (🦠) It was superimposed within the details of the waking question of the dream from when I was around 11 over 17 years ago where the words “what is that virus?” were previously present. This time I wasn’t filled with a sense of wondering what this oddly specific virus was that I was somehow supposed to know about, but rather the answer and knowing. I then immediately realized the significance regarding the way this dream ended the first time I had experienced it. This is an instance where I can’t quite emphasize enough with words the specificity of the exact tone of encoded awareness, but the way these spaces of waking awareness were superimposed with question/answer information and the way I tried to figure out why this question and notion that I should have a name to call the unknown yet known of dreamt of virus left no doubt as to the significance of the dream when I had an answer in place of a question this time around.",10-12-2020 01:42,0.0,1,724050000000000.0,100046000000000.0,"It's difficult to find a real dream these days here, most are imaginative figments blown up in some way. ....that said, that is a problem with dreams, that they prefigure events with symbols.

Hace dos días Dr. Peterson, cuyos lecturas me han ayudado muchísimo en tiempos difíciles... (cuales el mismo ha pasado el año pasado, por una fuerte dependencia a antidepresivos después de que su esposa fue diagnosticada con Cáncer.) tuvo una sita en línea con otro tremendo maestro, el señor Wim Hof.
Sus methodos incluyen una técnica de respiración muy simple pero tremendamente eficaz.

I'm aware it isn't healthy to suppress my negative emotions, so I do a lot of self-work to face my true feelings, but unless I'm with someone who I trust completely, they are not going to see that more emotionally honest side of me.

Even if I sense that I'm annoying someone, I won't be able to stop because it's such an ingrained automatic response. People like that will throw me into an autopilot people-pleasing
mode which doesn't turn off until the threat is gone. I realize after the fact that it's stupid and that the people pleasing is probably what's annoying them, but in the moment even the slightest sense of threat triggers the coping mechanism.

More than likely you feel that way for the same reason that I'm excessively happy. Somehow, having that reaction helped keep you safe as a child.

Now I wasnt afraid because I already read up on some literature pertaining to the true biblical representations of Angels.

The Left part of the brain controls the right hand
It has been said that left handers are more creative than right hand? Nevertheless your dream implies that you are forced to change the way you think (assuming you are right handed) and change the way you do things. We notice that all this change must be appropriated by your left hand, the creative hand but there are some more clues in your dream, one Being the term “plumbing”
Basic plumbing requires that water or liquid goes in the out or vice versa? To use a plumbing analogy the plumber wanting to find a potential blockage would determine where the blockage is then expose the blocked pipe then perhaps cut the pipe where the blockage is, clean it out and then simply fix it back again, sound familiar? in your case we can clearly see the cutting of the head and the hand. This is basically an operation to clear out a blockage in your way of thinking. For some reason your habitual way of doing things has become blocked. Then we see the “water being poured on the hand” to stop it drying outta stop your strength of life withering. The right hand speaks of strength and in your dream we see a healing operation talking place that is the pouring of water of life to keep your strength up while the healing takes place.
The next thing we see is the “stroke”..
Overview. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, to quote the bible (the life is in the blood) preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells begin to die in minutes. A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial.
So in your dream we can see that somewhere in your life quick action is required for healing to take place, perhaps some behaviour pattern that needs to be changed by quickly learning a different approach at doing things?
Next we see the the “lining up of the plumbing” what’s not lining up in your life? And we notice it must be the left hand which is doing all these creative adjustments, the lining up, the repairing and coordination action between your brain and your right hand, the way you’ve been doing things needed to be changed and now we see the left hand doing all this for you.
It would seem that the healing is a new coordination and balance of the way you function, you are learning something new that requires less effort by being creative.
The “running water” the spirit of life has been applied and you have aligned yourself with new values that all lend to healing. “your older brother seemed unresponsive” your older brother is the one who would normally be there to help his younger sister but is now unresponsive..a
t least to conventional treatment.
unresponsive
adjective: unresponsive
not responsive.
""these symptoms may be unresponsive to conventional treatment""
So you cannot rely on the older brother but your own instincts in this case are all working well for you.
The proof of healing showing you that the spiritual operation is successful is seen in the 2 scars which means that your healing process is still happening the plumbing pipes have been cleaned and sealed again noticeable by the healing scars.

1st: a doctor of questionable professionality made me take an elevator which led me deep down to an underground library. The library was empty, and creepy. There were scattered books and blood stains on the ground. I immediately realized that an insane violent woman lived there. The doctor commented on her absence, saying she must have been scared off. I noticed then that there was another woman that came with us. She looked scared and harmless. I hurries back to the elevator. I was afraid of remaining there. The doctor yelled : you know she is here!

2nd: I was walking in what looked like a supermarket. There were creepy female manequinns with tiny pupils. I knew they were alive and I taunted them by waving my hands in front of them, to see if their eyes would move. After a while they did, and the manequinns directed their blank stares towards me. I think my sister was there too. The manequinns were more inclined to stare at her. That's why I was trying to attract their attention. Even when they stared at me I continued taunting them to provoke some further reaction.

3rd: I was working at the front desk of a store. I met a cute girl there which I tried to speak to. She looked interested. (I think at this point there is a chunk of the dream I forgot, but it was not pleasant and it had to do with some entity that tormented me).
Then a boy comes to the front desk and brings me flowers. I'm worried because I don't want the girl to think I'm homosexual, but unfortunately she sees it and she seems amused. There was my sister too who joked by implying i had a family reunion and they brought me flowers.
Then that girl I liked appeared again and she bought a cd with music, saying she will buy one every month.
Then she paid a d went away. On the tray she left the money on appeared a writing: /what can you offer me? I know I had to sacrifice something so I gave some of the cheapest plastic bags.

For months I’ve been contemplating on sharing them in this group, but was hesitant on being judged for whatever reason and hesitant lol. I find the more I filter my body into a healthier state I dream better. I’ll start with this one. It’s short...

I had a meeting today with a friend and classmate on planning our careers in the future. The night before I found myself in my old elementary school waiting to visit my past teachers realizing they all retired. So I walked into the principal office to inquire where everyone went. As soon as I opened the door I seen the back of Jordan Peterson head & got excited hearing his voice knowing it was him. When he turned around he didn’t seem happy to see me he looked repulsed & backed away. As he was walking away I woke up.

There’s many more dreams & experiences I’ll share in the next coming weeks if I feel like it’s safe & relevant to do so. Right now I feel like it’s right to start off with this one considering how well everyone here deconstructs symbolism here lol. Mind you I’ve attended his Capitalism vs Marxism lecture & spent 2017-2018 consuming all his lectures on YouTube. Idk if that helps or if I’m just a bit obsessive 🙄🤦🏽‍♂️.

Turning my interest to those subjects I began recalling dreams.

The theme of returning back to school is a common one in dreams, perhaps in part it relates to the way dreams/the unconscious bring up old experiences to the surface, presumably to reprocess it. It could be an indication of the old age of the things which are now coming up, which I think the unconscious seems to naturally do gradually over time.

I'd guess that here, JP represents an aspect of your unconscious, and his repulsion from you seems to be simply on the basis of confronting it. Perhaps it illustrates the often antagonistic relationship between ego and the unconscious, which dream analysis and shadow work aims to reconcile. I'd say a lot of JPs ideas are related to shadow work.

Perhaps more simply, the dream could be seen to say that JP has been your sole, principal teacher, and one that you have now 'repelled' in a sense, walked away from.

I suspect that JP appears in a lot of 'compensation' dreams, but your dream here doesn't seem to be an example of compensation.

What are your own thoughts on this one?

2438,100000000000000.0,"Hello, I would like an interpretation of my dream that occurred last night. It was wacky and weird and I do not know what to make of it.

The first part consists of me riding in a misty morning on an empty lengthy road in between wetlands with leafless trees. Nothing crazy

The second part happens the next day, where my father told me to get to my hometown using his car. For some unknown reason, I am riding above our river that for some reason has multiple bridges that I am passing below me. Few times I fall down to the river (luckily it is not so deep) and I remember that father liked to get me into situations that are not pleasant for the sake of being more manly. I felt scared and used.

Nonetheless, I end up in my hometown next to a mountain (that is not there, we only have a small hill) I climb it up and for some reason, I have a hovering sofa above my shoulders ( It sounds stupid, but it was there) I climb up that hill and at the top, I even climb up our cemetery. and there I meet a nice girl. I strike up a conversation trying to get to know her, but somehow I am failing and becoming anxious. I see myself grinning uncertainly, and I fail to get her contact. She even had a dog and for some reason, I had her pictures with the dog on my phone. Kinda creepy.

It is getting late and I just arrived at my friend's house under a bridge we have in our hometown. I don't know why, but in my dreams, there is a small town there. Yet in reality, there is just a downwards path. I am charging my phone there and she is not around, I feel like I should not be there and the sofa is normally placed in her house. I tried calling her, but she did not answer

Suddenly I am in school with my great friend and we are goofing around. Suddenly I look at the pictures on my phone, where I see me, my friend, and a girl I fell in love last year. I thought it was weird since I deleted all of them and on one photo she seems genuinely sad/happy and I know that I am the reason.

And the last part. Its night and I am next to the cemetery with my cousin whom I admire deeply. He is innocently poking fun at my choices in women. He calls them "" Girl with a tattoo, Girl with dreadlocks, now a girl with a dog"" After that we look at a star on a grave beyond the cemetery wall. He makes a joke that does not make sense in any way. To which I respond smugly, yeah my brother already did that joke. And suddenly we hear heavy scratching sounds that are approaching us. He says it is a wolf, and that we should run before he sees us, he runs behind the wall of the cemetery, while I try to climb it up (these walls are smaller than me). Yet I fail, I try to run yet the wolf is already there looking at me. The walls change to a fence of our garden and the wolf starts running at me. I feel a sense of dread and fright. And then I wake up.

Weird thing is that I saw a shadow of this wolf running around my room and I tried to find it when I woke up.

Details:
-All of my dreams that are in my hometown start to descend into nightmares and our garden usually holds something negative.

-I was trying to talk to the girl to get over the girl I fell in love with last year

-The girl I was visiting and the friend I was goofing with are constantly with her and even tried to have a romantic relationship with her. So I left them both

I was inside a house with people I knew. Something happened to all those people (not like they were all murdered, but, like they just weren’t there anymore)

I came to the cognitive realization that I had lost everything and walked outside onto the grass where it was sunny and pleasant. There was a male friend who I never fully recognized with me outside but I think it was one of my older brothers.
I then made the decision to end things (this was cognitive and not done out of despair or sadness) so I took a long toothpick and inserted it through the top of my head into my brain. It felt strange but nothing happened.
I then panicked and tried to reverse the decision by pulling the toothpick out(which I knew would harm me). As soon as I pulled it out I got extremely light headed, fell to my knees, and, then onto my face in the grass.

The person with me engaged in friendly conversation the whole time until the end, but I don’t remember anything about the conversation.

2484,513631806.0,"So I had an unpleasant dream, which is fairly uncommon for me. I was at some kind of ceremony that I had a good amount of contempt for. We were very shoddily acting out a re-enactment of something. I remember having a vague idea of what I was supposed to be doing, but everything was screwed up. My contribution was the furthest off from the ideal, but it everyone else seemed content with the proceedings. Something significant was supposed to happen in the ceremony but a car crash or another kind of emergency outside made everyone focus on that instead.

However, while everyone was busying themselves with that I noticed a small, almost imperceptible scratch on my the end of my ring finger (I cant remember which hand). I started to squeeze it and puss started to come out. It wasn't painful, in fact it was pretty relieving to have it come out. It was kind of off-white or greenish initially, but as I kept squeezing it, eventually it turned into red, kind of like clotted blood. It didn't take long before I got all of the hardened stuff out of my finger and I as I did so I had garnered a fair amount of ""eww""s and ""yuck""s and ""doesnt that hurt?""

I don't do this in real life, so when I do it in my dream I become aware that I am not conscious. Here is a video of someone explaining what it kind of looks like:

Jacob Stephens‎Fans of K.W.M.L. (King, Warrior, Magician, Lover) by R. Moore & D. Gillette
21 October 2020 at 20:33 ·

I see a lot of similarities between the Stoic idea of 'amor fati' as well as 'Rule 12: Pet a cat when you see one' from JBP's book - as expressions of the 'Lover' archetype from King, Warrior, Magician, Lover.

Amor fati - being a sincere love (amor) and appreciation for the fate (fati) which befalls us

'Pet a cat' - being an allegory for taking a moment to focus on the little joys which life sends to us unexpectedly

'Lover archetype' - being the archetype which finds joy in the present moment

Thoughts etc?",21-10-2020 22:38,3.0,1,688918000000000.0,100003000000000.0,"Yes, defintely. I have found that the 12 Rules for Life can be rephrased and implemented in a several philosophical and psychological concepts such as daoism, stoicism and existentialism to name a few. This book has come about by combining a lot of information from a very, very, very brought number of different sources. For example the stoic titles of the chapters for 12 Rules for Life could look something like this; and I am quoting a few of the old stoics below. The quotes are numbered in accordence with the chapters of the book:

1. We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more in imagination than in reality. - Seneca

2. How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself? - Epictetus

3. The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best. - Epictetus

4. Curb your desire - don’t set your heart on so many things and you will get what you need. - Epictetus

5. Hang on to your youthful enthusiasms - you’ll be able to use them better when you’re older. - Seneca

6. Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one. - Marcus Aurelius

7. Don’t seek for everything to happen as you wish it would, but rather wish that everything happens as it actually will -then your life will flow well. - Epictetus

8. If it is not right, do not do it; if it is not true, do not say it. - Marcus Aurelius

9. If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid. - Epictitus

10. Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself. - Marcus Aurelius

11. True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not. - Seneca

12. When you arise in the morning, think what a privilege it is to be alive, te breath, to think, to enjoy, to love. - Marcus Aurelius.

And to tie them all together: Happiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one principle. Some things are in your control. And some things are not. - Epictetus

Or as the doctor himself said: It's all very well to think the meaning of life is happiness, but what happens when you're unhappy? Happiness is a great side effect. When it comes, accept it gratefully. But it's fleeting and unpredictable. It's not something to aim at – because it's not an aim. And if happiness is the purpose of life, what happens when you're unhappy? Then you're a failure. - Jordan Peterson",28-05-2020 12:01,150,581

He says he’s been to Seattle before.

I keep getting harassed by a group of dudes aggressively during this night of otherwise seemingly meaningless interactions hanging out. They’re Trying to intimidate me targeting me for some reason. Sticking trash in my pocket. This type of stuff happened to me in high school in real life. In the dream one of them, Mocks sticking a shiv in my neck by surprise and then the dude confronting me says, see what he just did that’s what you’re gonna get if you don’t give me your phone.

Since this is back in time, there were no iPhones, I had an iPhone which no one knew about. It was out of place with everything else occurring. Wierd... like the dream was trying to get rid of my future tech.

Nobody knows about coffee tea and I start a trend pointing out that it’s a cool place to hang and chill so all of a sudden a lot of people are there and it’s still just like a normal occasion type of feeling.

I meet this dude named chip who is actually a guy I knew much later in my life who was in a band, very talented but not famous just local cool guys in a local ska band, in the dream it’s when he’s 15 years old, same age as Eddie Veddar in this dream. I didn’t know him in real life at that age. I have weed and I tell him we’ll hang out. We hit it off like we always did in real life. There’s a band playing that is basic and blah and im hanging out with a whole group at a table
Just kids and Eddie veddar is just one of the guys in our crew obviously not important yet except to me since I knew the future.

I keep talking to him about his life. I tried writing it down for him to keep, but in the dream I can’t seem to get my hand to write letters. He has like a friend/brother who’s not interested wearing a mask like today except in the dream it’s not for Covid it’s just a fashion statement, but Eddie is interested in talking. We keep talking.

I keep getting jumped by this really pissed off group of guys with one dude in it who is very skittish... he’s the one who mocks sticking a shiv in my neck to let me know that could’ve been real and if I don’t confirm, next time it will be real.

I escape through a small service window and That one skittish guy follows me outside where it’s just us so I get a little more brave and start boxing him. Except in the dream I can’t seem to throw an actual punch it’s slow motion no impact. But he compliments my left hook and starts being complimentary in submissive psychopathic way. and then I wake up...shook.

...you know it's weird; 5 years ago I used to have these dreams too, but it was with my sister. It was persistent for a few months, then stopped the moment I dropped school to work. I couldn't really tell whether it was because during the waking hours I was now more engaged with the work environment, or because after a time, the change of mind track from caring over sister/family to personal (worked and lived alone far from home) took precedence, that eventually the dream resolved on its own, or something. Maybe someone here has another insight? But the caring over the sibling part... I suppose after a while, I am forced to look and see that I had to handle myself first, because my sister's a grown woman of her own too, and she's got to work that out herself.

The dream is a part of you and your subconscious which is influenced by your reality. Dreams often can mean things to a person where a 3rd Perspective can not always interpret as well as you can. I've had dreams in this manner as well. It shows your courage and also your mortality.

2978,1602850768.0,"“The mother is earlier than the son. The feminine has priority, while masculine creativity only appears afterwards as a secondary phenomenon. Woman comes first, but man “becomes.” The prime datum is the earth, the basic maternal substance. Visible creation proceeds from her womb, and it is only then that the sexes are divided into two, only then does the masculine form come into being. Thus, male and female do not appear simultaneously; they are not of the same order.… The female is primary, the male is only what comes out of her. He is part of the visible but ever-changing created world; he exists only in perishable form. Woman exists from everlasting, self-subsistent, immutable; man, evolving, is subject to continual decay. In the realm of the physical, therefore, the masculine principle is of second rank, subordinate to the feminine. Herein lies the prototype and justification of gynocracy; herein is rooted that age-old conception of an immortal mother who unites herself with a mortal father. She is perennially the same, but from the man the generations multiply themselves into infinity. Ever the same Great Mother mates with ever new men.”

The connection between what Joseph Campbell called ""follow you bliss"" and what JBP calls ""pursue what is meaningful""

This video by LSOO is Part 3 (also shared in the Fans of Joseph Campbell group) and it gave me a lot of thought in terms of the relationship between identity groups and the pursuit of meaning.
Identity in terms of the meaning we pursue and how we pursue that meaning - thus we relate to one another (in real life as well as in stories) yet by pursuing meaning first and discovering our group we find allies - the alternative is to declare a group and from that group derive our meaning and our goals.

In this sense I'm seeing a direct relationship between JBP's advocacy to pursue meaning, and his wariness of group identities.

Knowing what you want, what is meaningful to you and owning who you are. Also, with group identity there is a huge element of the shadow involved. Usually, when we have repressed traits, we project them on to others, but rather than own the traits and work with them, or project all of our unwanted traits on to those close to us, people end up joining groups that have ready made scapegoats on whom to project. This allows people to disown the shadow and feel self righteous. The penalty is they lose their individuality and the true meaning, the telos of their own life, which is revealed only by working on and relating to our selves.",28-05-2020 12:06,288,152

I prefer the suggestion that JBP suggests because it takes into account that life has suffering that cant be avoided. So if you have to suffer, you might as well do your utmost to reduce it for yourself and those around you because it's the best bet you have to create as much happiness while at the same time avoided the pain.

2993,100000000000000.0,"Haven't shared in a while, had some mild nightmares last night. Some paralysis in and out of being awake just remember gasping out ""help, help, help"" over and over. I think it's the remnants of grief that come around this time of year when my best friend took his life, I often find myself asthmatic in the days surrounding. Death anniversary was two weeks ago.
No distinct imagery unfortunately but distinct feelings of feeling trapped and suffocating.

Secondary nightmare was being critisized in the gym for being a phony. This was mostly in the context of me being trained by a past mentor that I've lost touch with even though they're only a few miles away.
I'm a personal trainer but out of work on that front, but still going to my fight gym regularly and trying to be helpful. I'm scared of rejection and being socially excluded while also trying to give the advice that has saved me from years of joint pain and inability to do the one reliable activity that improves my mental health that others probably feels similarly.
Distinct feelings of caring about what others think of me and wanting them to ""like"" me and validate me. Not wanting to feel dumb or feel inadequate but also reconciling that it is necessary for learning.

Maybe that made sense to someone.",06-10-2020 22:29,2.0,1,678019000000000.0,780839497.0,"Hmm, well this is just my take on the dream based on what you have said, and what I can relate to my personal experience.

I am thinking it relates to what you are working on within - the gym as a place where you work on yourself and it also doubles as your workplace - so it could relate to your workplace but I think with the work mentor it is relating to mentoring yourself, and that you are not being open/honest about yourself in some way.

My experience was very similar - not speaking my mind or sharing my opinion in case I was wrong, it wasn't my place since I know next to nothing.

But over even just these last few years I've almost reversed that completely, ever since, and dream interpretation was a huge influence on that, I stopped being afraid of being wrong. I think it's something like integrating in part the archetype of the fool.

Because now I put forward ideas without fear, and be ""vulnerable"" which is a wishy washy way of putting it makes it sound weak but I don't think it is. Because over time I have found being wrong is great, especially if you are open minded and listen to others views, not just taking on board what people say but if you understand what they are saying it corrects you a little. You won't grow at all if you are right every single time. Interestingly too, because I have taken on board and accepted idiocy, it makes me more prone to being made out to be stupid, but having that done to me actually has almost no effect. If I'm made out to be stupid it's like ""yeah I know, so what...""

I think framing things as opinion is critical to that, if you put your opinion as an unquestionable fact you can't budge, but if you frame it as opinion I have found people respond to it well and correct you without judgement. But if you come with a Sith-like absolute conviction you leave yourself with no room to move, it's like betting your ego on it, and if someone disagrees it becomes a challenge with so much riding on it. If it's an opinion, there's flexibility on both sides, and if you can bend it can be positive for the person correcting you because they get the benefit of correcting/
helping and in my experience generally don't actually judge you, even if they joke about it, and you also benefit from the learning.

I guess the down side is that people looking down their noses on stupid people. That's why characters like Homer Simpson, Peter Griffin, they're so unpopular and not loved, in comparison to the smarter more popular Brian the dog or Lisa Simpson hey.

It's like, people aren't intimidated by people who know more than them and will openly share information with them knowing they will be corrected and made out to be stupid. People love that.",28-05-2020 12:06,251,565

Dream 1:

I am baking something, some dessert pie.

The thing was I was doing this outside on the street outside where I grew up that had a parralel storyline at the same time where I was trying to overcome some ghost monster that was living upstairs in my childhood home, and at the same time I had a deadline to get this finished for work.

Dream 2:

Two prominent roller rinks in my city shut down, and people are sad about it.

I however discover an old abandoned facility in a wooded parkland near a river. I purchase this property and start developing the buildings.

Masha is out gathering fruit and mushrooms and is captured and forced to live with a bear (your ‘ghost monster’) who refuses to let her leave. She tricks the bear into taking her back to her grandmothers house by baking a bunch of pies. She hides under the pies, unbeknownst to the bear and tricks the bear into taking her back to her grandmothers house. When they arrive, the grandparents dogs smell the bear and chase it off and Masha pops out from underneath the pies.

Dream 2. Is not so obvious in terms of folk lore examples. There is a hint of the ice king who invented skating and sledding but it also has a common thread with the first dream. The first dream, pies are being connected to make a super pie. In the second dream buildings are connected by paving paths between the buildings.
Usually I see buildings as a symbol of the personal unconscious. This is because, like buildings or mazes or labyrinths, the personal unconscious is made up of ‘walls’ of contextualised ideas. Perhaps, I would say there is a thread here of joining things conceptually that might be usually separate distinct ideas. Sometimes over compartmentalis
ation can get in the way of the unconscious. If this is the case it could be a sign to find connecting threads between over compartmentalis
ed ideas. Without knowing you and knowing more it’s hard to offer more detail than that.",28-05-2020 12:07,248,285

Baking would normally be done inside but you are outside, on the street. Since there is a monster in your upstairs which obviously, through fear of some sort has impeded your natural growth. So now you do this from outside because you feel more comfortable since there is no monster to fear from the outside only within. I do t know what your fear is. But it’s great to see that you you still go ahead regardless and set out to achieve a full integration within yourself and when this is done the monster will be no more because your 3 parts will be one one and therefore too strong for him to impede your growth. Now is your time to see this through and you are doing everything right so you must succeed. Just as the 3 pies are separated within you, you have managed to separate the monster.

The word “Deadline” here is interesting because this is suggestive of you living a life of restriction because you are not properly baked together, yet. Perhaps the deadline can be seen in the gaps around the 3 different triangles, a sort of no mans land between prison and freedom? But then we see you applying the “honey mixture” you will no longer be isolated within but fully functioning and fully integrated instead of 3 seperate parts you will become whole and enjoy the sweetness of being whole instead of the dark gloominess of the prison cells within .

Your first dream was about the 3 pies and filling in the gaps and you bringing the 3 parts of yourself together.
Now again we see another set of 3, that is the 2 prominent roller rinks which are closed and the abandoned facility.
Closed and abandoned.
Roller Rinks themselves have undergone significant change. Starting out as Disco style rinks with disco music and old style wheels on hard floors with fog machines and flashing lights.This fad reached a peak in the 80s, and around 2006 discontinued. In 2020 roller skating began a resurgence
The end of the Disco Era and the advent of inline roller skates hit the roller rink industry hard, with many rinks closing. However, as had happened earlier, most rink owners adapted and survived the economic storm. Roller derby, a professional sport of the 1950s and 1960s once considered virtually dead, has seen a DIY, grassroots rebirth in popularity in the early 21st century with amateur and semi-pro teams forming leagues nationwide. Many rink owners support this activity, along with roller hockey, speed skating, and roller figure skating contests.
So, we see the history and GROWTH of Roller Rinks.
In your dream we notice 2 roller rinks closed and one abandoned! This is not the end but a NEW BEGINNING in your life.
In your dream I see you transitioning between one era, the younger era, and the new more modern era seen so clearly in the history of Roller Rinks.
It’s a time when people are sad because they see an era that has come to an end. But you on the other hand press forward buying up an abandoned facility to develop buildings. This is immense in that it suggests not only your own growth but that of others? Again notice the set of 3 stages..
1/one building is developed for general and social 2/then another building is developed for a Hockey Rink. 3/ then the next is for skaters with half pipes. So we see full integration in your own personal life. Gone are the days of gaps between the pies and gone are the days of disco a Roller Rinks with flashing lights but now we see MATURITY and SPECIALISED skills. Lastly we see again in fin detail a true picture of your growth and maturity as you work and live to your full potential skating with skill and ease between each building because you have again JOINED their pathways.",28-05-2020 12:07,248,449

3183,100001000000000.0,"Hey guys, this is a super length post where I go into depth with 2 lucid dreams.
So 2 weeks ago I got engaged and every night after for a week I had the same dream each night in a slightly different setting. The dream was that a significantly older man was chasing after me and wanted to perform unwanted sexual acts on me. It was quite disturbing.
On Friday night though, as I was running away, I moved into another dream where I was running down a stone cavernous hallway. I'm running away from something but I'm not sure what. I keep coming to wooden doors with ironwork designs on them and unlocking them with my old fashioned, black iron key. From around the right corner, before I run to each door, there is a woman with dark hair and eyes in a pink dress towing a mule on a rope. She walks around the corner before I run down the hallway where each door is so I see her 3 or 4 times as if I'm running down the same hallways again 4 times. I never look to see if she is coming from somewhere so I don't know if there is actually a corridor she's coming from.
Eventually, I run through one of the doors and there was a white field. I hear a voice behind me and it's a futuristic-looking boy of about 18 (picture cyberpunk goggles and dystopian future-looking clothing). He says something and before I can hear it, I realize I'm dreaming, wake up and I ask him, ""What are you doing here? Who are you? Why am I having this dream and what and I supposed to learn?"" He smiles coyly and says I can only learn that if I promise I'm still dreaming. I say yes and he leads me back around to where I previously saw the next wooden door in the fully white field, but now there is cobblestone and an old town. I've been here before but only during summer when he place looked like a mystical campground. Now it looks dark, cold and snowy. All the people are silhouettes and faceless. The boy leads me around the block and speaks but I can't really hear him. I'm more focused on the silhouette people (if you've seen inception, the people moved in a similar way except they were only shadows). There was also nobody in the houses. As we round the second last corner of the block, I tell the boy I changed my mind and that I want to go through the wooden door instead. He asks if I'm sure and when I say yes, I suddenly become quite cartoonish and dive through the wooden door like a superhero. My brother and I not fly through space as I chose the video game as if we are at a starting screen. I choose a game called SMASH and play as a miniature gorilla with veins all over its body except this character is MY body in the same way that Ready Player One works. I win enough fights that I get chosen as a champion for the last round where I fight against a blue zombie girl who rips my nervous system out of my body with her tongue and my fiance catches me and tells me it's okay and that my real-life body won't be affected, but I was terrified I would be horribly injured in real life.

On Sunday night, I was finally attacked by this older man who chased me except I didn't experience it in the dream, I just knew he had caught me after running away and watched him leave my apartment (this is now the 7th night in a row I've been chased by him but not caught until now. It's worth mentioning that I always know I'm dreaming and try to ""wake up"" so that I can make him stop chasing me but I'm always unable and he gets too close for comfort so I run away). Anyways, when he leaves, I escape out my apartment balcony by jumping and land safely, feeling guilty for leaving my dog behind. I sprint to catch the bus and when I board it, I begin to question if I am dreaming.

I Currently don’t have anything other then the evil (man & shadow) is just that, evil.

I know for myself, when I start the change things the dream gets harder to Control and more chaotic.

What are your Intrigues About the dream?",28-05-2020 12:08,1200,84
3184,100001000000000.0,"Hey guys, this is a super length post where I go into depth with 2 lucid dreams.
So 2 weeks ago I got engaged and every night after for a week I had the same dream each night in a slightly different setting. The dream was that a significantly older man was chasing after me and wanted to perform unwanted sexual acts on me. It was quite disturbing.
On Friday night though, as I was running away, I moved into another dream where I was running down a stone cavernous hallway. I'm running away from something but I'm not sure what. I keep coming to wooden doors with ironwork designs on them and unlocking them with my old fashioned, black iron key. From around the right corner, before I run to each door, there is a woman with dark hair and eyes in a pink dress towing a mule on a rope. She walks around the corner before I run down the hallway where each door is so I see her 3 or 4 times as if I'm running down the same hallways again 4 times. I never look to see if she is coming from somewhere so I don't know if there is actually a corridor she's coming from.
Eventually, I run through one of the doors and there was a white field. I hear a voice behind me and it's a futuristic-looking boy of about 18 (picture cyberpunk goggles and dystopian future-looking clothing). He says something and before I can hear it, I realize I'm dreaming, wake up and I ask him, ""What are you doing here? Who are you? Why am I having this dream and what and I supposed to learn?"" He smiles coyly and says I can only learn that if I promise I'm still dreaming. I say yes and he leads me back around to where I previously saw the next wooden door in the fully white field, but now there is cobblestone and an old town. I've been here before but only during summer when he place looked like a mystical campground. Now it looks dark, cold and snowy. All the people are silhouettes and faceless. The boy leads me around the block and speaks but I can't really hear him. I'm more focused on the silhouette people (if you've seen inception, the people moved in a similar way except they were only shadows). There was also nobody in the houses. As we round the second last corner of the block, I tell the boy I changed my mind and that I want to go through the wooden door instead. He asks if I'm sure and when I say yes, I suddenly become quite cartoonish and dive through the wooden door like a superhero. My brother and I not fly through space as I chose the video game as if we are at a starting screen. I choose a game called SMASH and play as a miniature gorilla with veins all over its body except this character is MY body in the same way that Ready Player One works. I win enough fights that I get chosen as a champion for the last round where I fight against a blue zombie girl who rips my nervous system out of my body with her tongue and my fiance catches me and tells me it's okay and that my real-life body won't be affected, but I was terrified I would be horribly injured in real life.

On Sunday night, I was finally attacked by this older man who chased me except I didn't experience it in the dream, I just knew he had caught me after running away and watched him leave my apartment (this is now the 7th night in a row I've been chased by him but not caught until now. It's worth mentioning that I always know I'm dreaming and try to ""wake up"" so that I can make him stop chasing me but I'm always unable and he gets too close for comfort so I run away). Anyways, when he leaves, I escape out my apartment balcony by jumping and land safely, feeling guilty for leaving my dog behind. I sprint to catch the bus and when I board it, I begin to question if I am dreaming.

I’d say you aren’t relating well to your instincts at this time. The shadow you saw was the shadow archetype which pops up when the ego is too one sided. This creates a shadow in the unconscious that blocks the relating factor (the animus) from reaching consciousness. The dog is also the animus. It’s appearance at the end of the dream is a positive sign since the animus when it appears as an animal indicates the disconnect from your instincts. If an animal shows up like a poisonous snake it generally means you are dangerously out of touch with instinct. The fact that your dog showed up and was pleasant to you is a sign you are better connected to your animus and so better at relating to your inner instincts and the outer world. Perhaps you have been wondering about the partner you are getting engaged to and I’d hazard a guess (obviously I don’t know either of you) but that perhaps you should trust your instincts about him. Look at him in a balanced way. See both positives and negatives. When you balance your perception of your partner you will get a clearer hit on your instincts.

My take on it is the older man represents wisdom I think, and the forced sexual acts and running from it is something along the lines of the refusal to accept some horrible truth , something you are not comfortable with which would be why the unwanted sexual act is used as a symbol.

I think this is then symbolised as a cyclic thing that you keep being forced toward something repeatedly over and over but refuse to confront, preferring to intellectually close the door on it. But it doesn't go away, it just comes back again and again.

I'm not sure what that would be, but I would think it relates to the donkey/mule/
ass being led by the soulless zombie chick all dressed up in a very feminine pink dress... Interesting because it shifts from the old masculine man to this image... I'm trying to wrap my head around that...

Then steam punk guy, might be around future stuff somehow, tries to make you confront this but you can't bring yourself to do it. You go back to the old cycle rather than learn what you don't want to.

Anyhow out of time maybe I look at the bus dream in a couple hours.",28-05-2020 12:08,1200,244
3196,100001000000000.0,"Hey guys, this is a super length post where I go into depth with 2 lucid dreams.
So 2 weeks ago I got engaged and every night after for a week I had the same dream each night in a slightly different setting. The dream was that a significantly older man was chasing after me and wanted to perform unwanted sexual acts on me. It was quite disturbing.
On Friday night though, as I was running away, I moved into another dream where I was running down a stone cavernous hallway. I'm running away from something but I'm not sure what. I keep coming to wooden doors with ironwork designs on them and unlocking them with my old fashioned, black iron key. From around the right corner, before I run to each door, there is a woman with dark hair and eyes in a pink dress towing a mule on a rope. She walks around the corner before I run down the hallway where each door is so I see her 3 or 4 times as if I'm running down the same hallways again 4 times. I never look to see if she is coming from somewhere so I don't know if there is actually a corridor she's coming from.
Eventually, I run through one of the doors and there was a white field. I hear a voice behind me and it's a futuristic-looking boy of about 18 (picture cyberpunk goggles and dystopian future-looking clothing). He says something and before I can hear it, I realize I'm dreaming, wake up and I ask him, ""What are you doing here? Who are you? Why am I having this dream and what and I supposed to learn?"" He smiles coyly and says I can only learn that if I promise I'm still dreaming. I say yes and he leads me back around to where I previously saw the next wooden door in the fully white field, but now there is cobblestone and an old town. I've been here before but only during summer when he place looked like a mystical campground. Now it looks dark, cold and snowy. All the people are silhouettes and faceless. The boy leads me around the block and speaks but I can't really hear him. I'm more focused on the silhouette people (if you've seen inception, the people moved in a similar way except they were only shadows). There was also nobody in the houses. As we round the second last corner of the block, I tell the boy I changed my mind and that I want to go through the wooden door instead. He asks if I'm sure and when I say yes, I suddenly become quite cartoonish and dive through the wooden door like a superhero. My brother and I not fly through space as I chose the video game as if we are at a starting screen. I choose a game called SMASH and play as a miniature gorilla with veins all over its body except this character is MY body in the same way that Ready Player One works. I win enough fights that I get chosen as a champion for the last round where I fight against a blue zombie girl who rips my nervous system out of my body with her tongue and my fiance catches me and tells me it's okay and that my real-life body won't be affected, but I was terrified I would be horribly injured in real life.

On Sunday night, I was finally attacked by this older man who chased me except I didn't experience it in the dream, I just knew he had caught me after running away and watched him leave my apartment (this is now the 7th night in a row I've been chased by him but not caught until now. It's worth mentioning that I always know I'm dreaming and try to ""wake up"" so that I can make him stop chasing me but I'm always unable and he gets too close for comfort so I run away). Anyways, when he leaves, I escape out my apartment balcony by jumping and land safely, feeling guilty for leaving my dog behind. I sprint to catch the bus and when I board it, I begin to question if I am dreaming. I can't think around the fact that the dream took place in my apartment for a moment, but I work around that by considering that the apartment I just saw was unpainted and I recently painted mine, and that I escaped bgy jumping which would be impossible. I suddenly wake up and can't tell if I'm dreaming or really on the bus so I ask the woman in front of me, ""excuse me Bonnie, where is this bus going?"" Because I knew if she answered then I was obviously dreaming since I could call her anything and have her answer. She said something like, ""Oh well, things are going all over the place these days and I can't hardly ever keep track. I just go for the ride."" I woke up and told the bus to stop, which it did and all the passengers froze. Next, I pointed to the ground and wanted for my dog to be there and he appeared and listened when I told the dream that he needed to be a good boy (he lay down and smiled). Next, I closed my eyes, told the bus to go to a lavender field on a beach instead, and when I opened my eyes the bus pulled up near a beautiful beach where I stepped off, smelt the sea air and lay in the field to relax. I haven't had the horrible dream of being sexually chased since.

So I'm thinking this is an inner conflict you are fighting between the masculine side and feminine side. I'm thinking this could be the thinking vs feeling aspects. Maybe that is why earlier it is running from the male and the female - running from the conflict of the two. Perhaps that is the significance of this fight? You don't want to confront it because of the nerves (ripping out the nervous system)?

It also could be implied in the chicks being zombies; ie not thinking pending weight to the feminine feeling aspect in polar opposition to the thinking side?

Are you conflicted on what you think vs feel over something? Daniels link to Bluebeard as a mythical symbol could imply that it relates to the engagement, though I am not getting anything else in the dream that would imply that, unless he is a bit of an ass that you have to lead around everywhere hence pink zombie chick; as a part of you that you aren't facing up to...?",28-05-2020 12:08,1200,201

3235,100040000000000.0,"I often get nightmares and most of them never really bothered me but this one did so I’m sharing this in the interest of getting some insights from you guys.

I had a dream that I was smoking a cigarette, walking by a busy and narrow street. This place looks like a favela, although much cleaner and the ambiance was happy and full of energy. Unlike the slums where I used to live where it smells piss and dead rats. It was the first time I have dreamed of such a place.

I was about to cross the street when I noticed the people started running out of this man’s way. This guy was riding a scooter. He was wearing a denim cap, green long sleeve shirt, light wash pants and a pair of slippers. On his back was a sheath with a long and heavy machete with blood on it. He also had a gun but I can’t recall if it was a shotgun or a rifle. I felt something very evil and sinister as he went past me.

Then I went to this share house, upstairs where I was supposed to be living: talked to my housemates and did some other things I couldn’t recall, but I’m pretty sure those parts were fun that I forgot about the guy in the green shirt.

I climbed the staircase and opened the door at the end and there I was on the rooftop smoking another cigarette. This share house was relatively taller than most buildings that I could watch the neighbors through their windows, the street market and the people walking around. It felt very calm.

Then this woman busted out of the door - also wearing a green shirt - shaking and crying, begging for help. This woman was bleeding all over and I could see one of her eyes sticking out of her face with a huge open wound on her temple showing her cracked skull. I asked her what happened and she said “he’s here”. Then I remembered the man with a green shirt.

Then the mood of that dream turned into something out of a horror movie. The sky turned blood red. The people around were shouting “watch out! Lock your doors!”, warning the others including me. The commotion kept getting closer and closer; the kind of noise you would hear from people screaming in terror. Then I heard loud thuds inside the share house and the footsteps on the staircase. I realized that he was after the woman.

I shouted at the neighbors to call the cops. I locked the door on the rooftop from the outside with just a slide lock using a concrete nail as the barrel bolt. That way it could buy us some time at least.

I grabbed her and we jumped and ran on the roof of other houses and shacks. Then I woke up.

Any thoughts?",15-09-2020 00:32,0.0,2,667670000000000.0,643937657.0,"This is a dream about your shadow and the Anima plain and simple. The shadow is the part of the psyche that compensates for one sidedness in the ego. For example if you become too self righteous in some area your shadow becomes darker in compensation. In dreams it shows up for a man as a male ‘other’ or a dark and sinister place. In the case of this dream it is both.
The Woman is the Anima. The anima is the relating factor of the psyche and it helps us relate to both our inner world and outer world. It shows up in a man’s dreams or fantasies as a woman or animal. It is usually projected onto a woman since one of its roles is to help in relating to a mate for the continuation of the species which is a vital role. It is usually misinterpreted as an inner woman. It’s not. It’s an aspect of the male psyche that gets projected onto a woman.
Now, the interesting part. When we go inward to our collective Unconscious, the first thing we usually encounter is our shadow. Like I said, when the ego becomes too one sided, the shadow activates as a compensatory mechanism to bring the psyche back into homeostasis. While this self regulation is happening, we lose the connection with our relating factor, the Anima (for a woman Animus). When we lose touch with our Anima, when it is clouded over by the shadow, we lose touch with our deeper instinctive self and it’s impulses. This manifests an internal psychological pressure which may come in the form of anxiety or anger. It’s kind of an instinct ‘wounding’. Another interesting thought is the wound on the eye of the Anima. It’s the dreams way of showing you that while the shadow is active, it is not able to perform its task of looking inward or outward to full capacity.",28-05-2020 12:08,547,370
3432,1763432242.0,I had a dream last night. I dreamed that I was with Dr. Peterson walking through my city. We walked side by side he spoke and I listenened. I felt so overwhelmed that I had the priviledge to spend time with Peterson and walk with him like he is my close friend. He taught me some good 'psyche tricks' and how to spot liars etc. I hadn't had a good dream for a while but this was just so exciting and good.

In Genesis God walks with Adam in the Garden similar to you and Peterson walking through your city. Both God and Peterson walk with Adam and you through there own respective area,s.
As God walks with Adam he teaches him to cultivate the garden because God is a Husbandman he teaches him Knowledge (tree of knowledge) and he shows him how to continually regenerate his life (tree of Life) in short God created Adam and Adam enjoyed these walks with God until he sinned.
In your case I see Something similar, Peterson has created a following. He walks with you(continually
instructs those he created) but here is where it’s different instead of knowledge and imparting of spiritual life suggesting honour and integrity. Instead we see tricks and lies? In the dream we see that Peterson is your “close friend” I wonder if you have created “a Peterson” that will teach you what you want to hear? This idea is not too far fetched since that’s exactly what man has done, they forgot the true God and created their own god.romans 1:23
and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.
So I see the exchange taking place here,as you walk with this “close friend” in your city/ garden. What is noticeable is that “psyche tricks (mind games) and “how to spot liars”
a small round or roundish mark, differing in colour or texture from the surface around it.
.
see, notice, or recognize (someone or something) that is difficult to detect or that one is searching for.
To spot something is basically to detect it then mark it/ spot it.
Again this is exactly what God did with Cain after the murder of Able, he spotted him that is he placed a mark upon him so that others seeing Cain would not harm him for what he did to His brother see gen 4:15
The mark of Cain is God's promise to offer Cain divine protection from premature death with the stated purpose of preventing anyone from killing him. It is not known what the mark was, but it is assumed that the mark was visible.

So we see that when God spotted the liar he then marked him out for DIVINE PROTECTION untill he could devise a way to brim him back to integrity or REDEEM him since he was unable to redeem himself.",28-05-2020 12:10,98,473

Peterson here appears as a ‘wise man’ here instructing you with some good psyche ‘tricks’. When I say the ‘Self’ I’m not referring to the ego, but the summation, the totality of the psyche from the persona, to the ego, to the Shadow and Anima and all the other aspects of the collective Unconscious.
It would be fitting that the ‘Self’ (Peterson) would be instructing you in ‘tricks’ of the psyche since it is the cumulative knowledge of the whole psyche. Interesting about spotting liars. Many people suspect people of lying sometimes but then go against their instincts and trust the person only to be betrayed. Your ‘Self’ which has the knowledge of millions of years of evolution built into it, can give you access to wisdom that your conscious mind and it’s constructs may not have access too.

Lurking in my brain I thought I’d drop it here.
I can’t remember the whole dream but the specific part I do remember is that I was in my childhood home. I walked into the living room and my Grandfather (who is passed) was standing looking out the window with his arms crossed.
I went to the window to see what he was looking at because there was a strange glow coming from outside. I stood beside my Grandfather, who didn’t say a word. Or move for that matter. It was snowing, but the snow was almost shaped like a curved peanut in the shell and it was cascading down, heavily, in a back and forth motion that would resemble a feather floating down. I was a bit anxious about it and I heard my Mother angrily tell me— from somewhere in the background that it was just snow and that I was being ridiculous.

I tried telling her that it wasn’t normal, she wouldn’t look. I looked up at the sky and the clouds were huge and heavy and oddly close to the ground.

I was exploring a cave with a very high ceiling. I was trying to go deeper in the cave, when I got stuck on this giant lake in the cave. There were a couple of small rocky platforms for me to jump across with stalagmites to hide behind. The reason I had to hide behind them was because, sitting in the middle of the lake, there was a giant, skinny old man (I could see the outlines of his ribs) with a long, thin, grey beard. His eyes were closed shut, but it was as if they were open, and any time I crossed his field of vision (maybe while jumping platforms), he would raise his fists and splash the water so hard that it would create great waves and try to carry me away, and I’d have to wait for the water to be still again.

There was a story in my dream that went along with this giant old man. He suffered a great tragedy and hid in the cave many years ago. The lake was made of all his tears from crying. He cried for years and years, until he finally stopped crying and just sat there in the middle of this lake, immovable unil he attempted to drown anyone who tried to pass through by splashing the Great Lake.

You enjoy/ “love”making music with computers? You “love” making music this way.
Love:
1:an intense feeling of deep affection.
2: a great interest and pleasure in something.
Notice the similarity here in your phrase “I love to make music” compare your cooking.. you love making scrambled eggs (cooking) seen by the way you add the herbs. The herbs bring out the flavour of the food just like when you make music on the computer, you are basically cooking up your music to the right mix and have the ability to add ingredients via the software program. These ingredients are similar to the herbs you use to flavour the scrambled eggs.
Now, we can perhaps understand something? When you applied the herbs to increase the flavour “it tasted terrible”
So now let’s go back to your music you make with love (herbs)
Could it be that even though you love to make music that at the moment it’s palatable but a little scrambled? Could it also be that even though you “love” what you do but you see the need to add more flavour to your music except this time the love (herbs) you added made it “ taste terrible” that is we can understand that even though you add love to your music it’s still not yet the right mix?
Herbs:
1:any plant with leaves, seeds, or flowers used for flavouring, food, medicine, or perfume.

So the themes of being aware/
conscious/
unaware/
unconscious/
becoming aware - the transition between states of awareness - and the tunnel through which water flows seem to go together in both of these two experiences.

In your dream the water was low in the tunnel, in mine it was high, and I was up to my neck in it, which imo is primarily due to the two experiences happening at different times, ie the level of water, specifically, seems to coincide w/the point in time, and it's the detail around it that contains the more personal aspects, and what it might say about you. In other words, the high or low water in itself doesn't tell you about you as a person as distinct from others at this time.

Recalling dreams is always a case of 'becoming aware' or 'becoming conscious of what was previously only perceived unconsciously',
which is also the theme of your dream. You have fascinating dreams.

On a point of interest, your dream also has a symbol in it which is the opposite of a more well known dream motif, namely of being naked in public places, like in Genesis, whereras you noted you were dressed in bed, the opposite. Again, that detail is due to the point in time.",28-05-2020 12:11,305,353

I was 17-18 so about 15-16 years ago. One of my best friends and I were walking on a plato along the ocean the plato was orangish redish like the Grand Canyon colorful flowers beautiful clear sky the ocean was calm and crystal clear you could easily see all the coral and tropical fish even though the table of the plato was a good way above the water, basically imagin the most beautiful ocean seen you possibly could. So my friend and I are walking smoking a joint and talking “can’t remember a thing about the conversation” anyway I decide I’m jumping off the plato and tell my buddy he agrees it’s the right thing to do so we jump. It was as amazing as I thought it would be everything was so pretty. Then a dolphin swam close to us and let us pet it I decided I’m riding this damn thing so I grab it’s top fin and away we go he took me all over showing me all the beautiful things it was great I was having such a good time after a while I thought man I’m hogging the dolphin Marky needs to do this too so we go back to my friend and I let him have a turn. That’s when it went down I guess the dolphin didn’t like my buddy cause he started ramming him knocking him out of the water and there’s nothing I can do I have no weapon and you can’t fight a dolphin in water with no weapon and win so I’m terrified my buddies limp body just getting thrashed and nothing I can do about it then I woke up. So it went from probably the best dream I’ve ever had directly into one of the scariest dreams I’ve ever had.",03-09-2020 21:14,1.0,1,655234000000000.0,100003000000000.0,"It sounds something like you had great peace and clarity, almost like you were attune with the world around you. Both you and your friend took a plunge into the ‘underworld.’ You thrived in it, and when you encountered a beast of the underworld, you conquered and subjugated it by riding it, possibly an integration with the shadow (dolphins can be both quite compassionate and quite sadistic creatures). However, you’re friend had no such luck. Perhaps your dream is worried that your friend might not be able to weather the chaos to come. I know that sounds bleak, but I hope it’s helpful",28-05-2020 12:11,387,121
