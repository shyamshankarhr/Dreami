I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?"").

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:40:19,1235685116953144,https://facebook.com/1235685116953144,100001037053553,Terry Dey,Elisah Meis I agree but we've noticed many of our dreamers arent always English proficient because its not their primary language so sometimes we have to work with it,2021-09-08 14:40:34

In the dream I was inside his life such as me reliving what he seen inside the house while he was present only for work. I seen the woman underage son with a loaded gun that she allowed him to have. Then I looked on the refrigerator and seen that she was posing with yet another married man that works at her job. So I was looking around her house and seen things I didn’t wanna see happening that she let her kids do. I gained access to my husband Facebook account and added the daughter to his page and his mother was furious especially him. I quickly deleted her from the social media as I did before on my personal page. I came to my mom house and she was calling my dad. My dad showed up very tall that it scared me. I seen his big truck parked backwards in the driveway and I seen my husband ex in the truck kissing what I thought was my husband. It was her baby father. I screamed I thought you said I wasn’t gonna have to deal with this anymore but I watched her threw her youngest child down to the ground on the big truck like she could care less.,2022-05-08 14:26:53,0.000000,1,0,1418350805353240,https://facebook.com/1418350805353240,410066253948006,Group member,The man that she was standing in the photo with is also married to a woman with a same name as her but he looks nothing like my husband.,2022-05-08 14:37:36,,,,,,

I was walking on some land, a vast area covered in green grass and some plains and some little hills/dunes looked like a valley. There was a lone tree. A big massive tree in distance. The leaves were all purple colour and it had some little white flowers. There was wind, not too strong, but the little flowers were flown away in the wind and falling like a flower rain. I was walking past the tree and I wasn’t alone but with someone. I don’t know who that is but someone close/familiar with. They gave me a flower that was caught floating in the air.

I feel it reflects a sense of peace as you navigate the peaks and troughs of your life at the moment. I feel the tree with the purple leaves represents your spiritual growth. You have become strong and indipendant, perhaps unique in your path. The person you walk with is aspect of yourself who wants you to stop for a memento appreciate how far you have come.

Assis,"I can strongly affirm at the least that you cannot ‘dream or imagine’ anything NEW (as in something you didn’t recently see, observe throughout life or as a child, possibly even connecting different aesthetics or characteristics
of animals and such, no NEW details or designs can be created basically, history and life repeat themselves until change is enacted). Therefore, it’s quite possible that because of the larger setting, environment of a big fancy house party and future, you dreamt of perhaps even a thought of living a different life than hers (including yours perhaps at the moment). She could be spiritually messaging you through the afterlife (dream medium) to tell you to take risks. This is similar to how she told you a permanent goodbye in the dream setting, yet you still saw her land safely on someone else and continue on? So basically, she’s telling you that goodbyes aren’t forever if you love someone, and to take advantages of opportunities while you can as ‘risks.’

By connecting logic with your subconscious, you are correct because you cannot just imagine something NEW or create something that you have not seen details of before. You are 100% in the acceptance&refl
ection stage of loss or life in general, thereby you have let go of her control/
influence, however you still love her and value her opinion.

Understand that the only thing stopping anyone from ‘letting go’ is themselves, you may love someone and not need to heed their opinions on your own entity.

Those last few lines are enough to show how you feel, you already understand that ‘you miss every shot you don’t take, but what does getting a shot mean to you?’ philosophy or mindset.",2022-05-08 10:40:47,1418085582046429,https://facebook.com/1418085582046429,777843956533657,Group member,Vinny O.

The people were aspects of your deeper psyche you've accessed either as a response to a stimulus, or in alignment with a global phenomenon (spiritual ascension). These may be parts of your psyche that connect with the Collective Unconscious.

You faint when you hear a voice asking you if you're OK. This to me indicates ""finding"" the right ""self"" to fall back on.

He was a ""nurse"".. Very apt. Your New Masculine Energies from this quick shift are very healthy and ""healing"" for the Feminine energies that are wounded.

Hole in chest (Heart Chakra) is the ""sudden"" shift in consciousness I mentioned. It could be indicating the cause of this shift eg some emotional trauma etc but you have a very well grounded inner Masculine that is helping you ""heal"" (your power of discernment, responding instead of reacting, taking action with strategy, being responsible etc).

EDIT: Please look into breathing practices and kindly use them during Meditation.

I always suggest practicing Earthing and Grounding, and increasing water intake. These practices help us ""ascend"" more smoothly.

Ascension is linked with shadow-work. Shadow-work is linked with self-awareness.
Dreams help us increase our self-awareness.",2022-05-08 06:40:58,,,,,,

We went to the grocery store and went to get haircuts and buy clothes but we only got to the shops half an hour before they closed but the staff let us stay in this store past closing and we chatted with them. Then we headed to see my partners family. I had a really large box with personal stuff in it, I can’t remember exactly what. I left it on the side of the road and throughout the day I went back and forth to it. The last time I went out to it, it was empty and I felt really sad about my things being stolen. I couldn’t remember what was in the box so I tried to just let it go and not be worried about it.

For context, in waking life my partner and I are going to her family’s place for lunch today for Mother’s Day. I also revealed some past trauma details to my partner the other day and as I type this out I am seeing parallels between that and the box on the road.

I went to his house to invite him, letting him go by himself and then went to see A. in his bedroom. It was on the 3rd floor. He was very happy to see me and asked me if I had a gift for him so I show him my naked body, and we had sex (very realistic dream 😅)

Then we had to go to meet our fathers to eat, so I let him shower and went back to a place I’ve already been to go to his house, but then it was a long white corridor with mirrors all along. At the end of the corridor there was a patio with people that were my professors or colleagues (maybe at work). And then I took a look at myself in the mirror, breathing and bumping my belly as if I was pregnant, and then I recognize I was being pregnant after having sex with A

*********************************

I wouldn’t have a relationship again with A
This dream seems so realistic, makes me feels like announcing a pregnacy to come (maybe twins pregnancy because of the two eggs and the two buns), but I am single by now 🤨

I was watching a baby. It felt like it was a baby from someone close to me, but I don’t know this baby in real life. I just changed its poopy diaper and within 30 seconds after changing the baby, it looked at me, then at its diaper and I immediately noticed it had pooped again, because baby poop came out at the top of the diaper. I got angry at the baby and smacked his stomach. 😭 Immediately after doing that I regretted it and didn’t understand why I got so angry and violent.

Later in my dream I was on a rollercoaster in a single cart and when I looked behind me I saw the baby, also in a single cart, about 5 meters away from me. I realized that babies are not supposed to be taking rollercoaster rides, especially all by themselves. But at that point there was nothing I could do, so I yelled: “Hold on tight!” Genuinely hoping that that would help. 😅 Anyway, my cart starts racing and a few seconds later I see the baby fall out of the cart and it drops dead on the ground. I felt terrible, but at that moment I kinda realized (or hoped?) I was dreaming and I felt like I could maybe change the outcome, but I don’t remember much after that.",2022-05-07 21:10:02,0.000000,1,0,1417628668758787,https://facebook.com/1417628668758787,100009043123809,Purple Liz,"You're getting angry and impatient with your own vulnerability, especially when difficult emotions come out.

This is because water (among others) represents life and a bath is a vessel that holds water. Dreams like this could invite you to accept yourself as a woman and see this in a better light. Too often uterus and reproductive area is dumping ground for negative energy (black gunk) that follows the negative thoughts (hair) about ourselves as women.

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:41:42,1235686206953035,https://facebook.com/1235686206953035,100001027268137,Elisah Meis,Thats true... however a bit more info would be extremely helpful.,2021-09-08 14:41:56

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Kind of odd that I’d have this dream right before Mother’s Day but last night I had a dream that I watched my mom die. In the dream it started out in a party where myself & my mom were at, separately. I was with one group and I saw her with another. It’s unclear why but my mom volunteered to take some type of lethal pill. I didn’t realize what was going on, until it was too late. People were surrounding her as she lay in the middle of the floor, struggling to breathe. I came over and she told me to give my aunt a message from her before she’s gone. I don’t remember the message now, but I called her up immediately and let her know in the dream. My mom hung around for a while before they noticed the pill wasn’t working, she was still trying to live but very weak. At that point someone there in a red dress grabbed a pillow and essentially put her to rest. I was right there with her until that pillow incident-I couldn’t be near watching it in the dream. I was sobbing in the dream-and retelling it is really getting me worked up. Anyway, I came to ask if there’s some meaning in this dream bc I’m kind of freaking out 😭",2022-05-07 19:37:31,0.000000,1,0,1417600595428261,https://facebook.com/1417600595428261,100001037053553,Terry Dey,"Maritza Magarin powerful dream. Theres a few possibilities. Unless your mother in waking life is dealing with end of life issues, the dream is most likely about something other than her death. If we go with the idea that all the characters in the dream are aspects of yourself...the dream may be about a change in your relationship with her. Death of old mother or mother roles. If your mother is changing in life...in decline mentally, or physically.....
..or if she was a difficult mother and you are finally able to release her from that ""superior"" role....these are possibilities. Perhaps if you are a mother and are choosing to be different with your children than your mother was with you...that too could be the symbolic death of your mother. Essentially its about a change. The end of old. Beginning of new.",2022-05-07 21:42:06,,,,,,

I have been having weird / horrible dreams lately and it’s giving me more anxiety than ever before. Hopefully someone can help interpret it for me?

2 weeks ago I dreamt I remarried my husband but it was an all black wedding my wedding dress was black I didn’t see anyone else but him not sure what that would mean but I felt uneasy about it.

The next week I dreamt my 2 year old lost her top front tooth I couldn’t remember the details but that same night my 8 year old dreamt she had stitches.

Last night finally I dreamt of discovering a snake in cage it was red and it had a beak (weird) it didn’t seem to attack me or anything but I felt uneasy and I eventually woke up afterwards.

Assis,"Hi, I’m not a psychologist but I do study logic/theory + spirituality and sacred geometry.

1.) the ‘black wedding’ seems to be a passing, or some sort of afterlife meeting, like either you both met again in the afterlife or were accepting some sort of unchangeable loss/
experience.

2.) They’re close in age (fairly), probably were older or in their eternal/
spiritual form in their dreams and fought each other, or they fought as adults in their dreams lowkey LOL

3.) Since nothing else logically makes sense imma assume this is the brain connecting random uneventful things you saw and fused in your subconscious. You may have watched an animal documentary or compilation, and your psyche pieced together a snake, bird, and cage for a pet (these details are all animal related, so that at least connects).",2022-05-07 00:00:00,,,,,,

Since wedding is all black and you felt uneasy it can mean you are viewing this commitment as potentially bad. Your husband can be symbolizing something else like your logical side or even something you working. It doesn't necessarily mean anything about your relationship and probably has some other meaning. Two year old losing a tooth dream: it is natural for little kids to be losing teeth so I wonder what your feelings were about this. When we dream about losing our teeth as an adult it often has to do with feeling insecure about changes. A beaked red snake in a cage might have something to do with feing like you're holding back expressing anger but it's really difficult to say without more details as snakes can represent so many things and so can colors.,2022-05-07 17:42:17,,,,,,

There were two glasses of fizz drinks on the tray. It was poured into a glass. I choose White coloured fizzy drink and my niece choose Blue coloured fizzy drink. I took a couple of sips from the White fizzy drink it tasted sweet. Can anyone help interpret this dream?,2022-05-07 17:37:12,0.000000,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

So being late is kind of like its about time your facing up to this, probably not the first time you faced the circumstances but your finally not just ignoring and moving on but taking note of your role in whatevers going on and adapting to stop having to repeat the situation in future.

Forgetting your material I'd see more like you are unprepared to take on this lesson properly, like you need to learn something else first or need to use certain ""analytic tools"" to understand that you arent willing or comfortable eith to use.

But thats all generalisation,
and dreams are subjective so highly variable.",2022-05-06 00:00:00,,,,,,

You would think it would have to do with learning something since the location is school. But I always have trouble relating it to something in my life. I am always learning stuff but it never seems like the dream relates. Sometimes I can't find the classroom which you would think would mean I can't figure out where to go to learn what I need to learn. But I don't ever feel that way. And sometimes I can't get in my locker or find my locker to get to my books which you would think would mean I don't have access to learning materials on the topic, but that's not the case either. So I have no idea. Maybe it is the feeling that is most important. I feel, like you said - lost, unsure of where I'm going. Maybe it just means that.",2022-05-06 00:00:00,,,,,,

My mums family have not been nice to me and said some horrible things about my husband and me when my mum brother Aunt and cousin and family friend put my poor father in care home over 5 years ago and passed away over 4years ago. It is still difficult going to my mums as she is still alive especially when I visit her. I know she could not look after my dad as she was in her 80s but my brother should have done something. Sometimes I try not to say something and sometimes I have to protect myself. My mum also told me only last year she had another baby but gave her up for Adoption which I am still trying to get used to. She has had a lot of secrets which she told me years later. Thank you for letting me know. Hope you do not mind me explaining things about my mum as I was in her flat when I could see this hospital letter about my husband in my second dream.

Started crying n i stoped walking n put him on a seat standing so i can get more lved with him n i ask ""whats wrong?"" As i was thinking - how can you be in a place like this and be crying(because we were surrounded by tall trees and wilderness area where we lived in the town) - i asked 2 times before he answered, the first time he didnt want to say like his parents never wanted to hear him out n he looks down. I lift his chin up softly ""hey hey hey. . . look at me . . please"" i say softly and he looks at me n i let his chin go. ""What is wrong? Whats making you so upset? I really want to know"" I ask as we looked each other in the eyes. He seamed to calm down and says in a little bit of a whine ""Its boarding here and theres nothing to do. Its always the same"" i give a moment of silence before responding ""Ok how about this, when were done here i will play with you, anything you want. How about that?"" I asked n smiled being very caring about what i say which match my energy. ""Mhumm"" the kid responds with nodding. I smile at him happily ""When were done here well play ok"" i say and the kid calms down completely n nods i then picl him up. (The dream skips further ) i finished what i needed and gave the kid back to the parents but before i leave i ask the child ""alright. Are you ready? What do you want to do?"" I ask the child seeing a smile grow on him before i woke up.
During the dream and hearing the kid i was concerned from his crying and listened to his words very closely. My expressions were obviously worryed and concerned the child noticed which i was able to tell with how he calmed down and his facial expression.

One was scared of me the other came right onto my hand. They couldn't fly and it was raining. They were soaked. I noticed a hole and in the hole were other humming birds like they were hatching but not out of eggs it looked like embryo sacks. As I was watching 2 stray cats came up and were trying to attack the humming birds, I kept them away from them. I dont remember why I left but I came back to check on them and they were all dead and one of the cats had a dead humming bird in its mouth and I was very upset.

I visit the town and I walk along the street with someone Idk (but do in this dream). I realise something is wrong and that all of the shops now have weird names. Still their names but either with a night/dream pun or some night/dream logo.
The person idk (Let’s call him P, I guess) sat on a bench and I ask them wth is going on, they confirm it was my town but that it’s called Whoville now. Very confused, we walk into this shop. The manager is walking around shouting ‘Make sure […] don’t fall asleep in my shop!’. Some guy looks drunk and as if he’s going to fall asleep. P helps him out of the shop and he’s grateful.
Soon after, the shops begin to close and the place looks dark and gloomy. All the shops looked as if they were abandoned. Broken windows, lights, and cafés had food laying around. People walking around went into different shops. A group of women were in this café next to me and began eating. Quickly, they all collapsed. P complains that this is just like ‘so and so shop’ and that people just shouldn’t take the risk anymore! I quickly realised that they were all dead.
(For some reason) I and P break the windows of a real estate shop and see this very old, short man with black hair and small glasses. He wore old fashioned but fancy clothes. We talk to him for a bit, ask him questions etc. Turns out that you can either leave your shop in view or hide it. If you leave it in view you can leave a light on to let people know […]. He said that it was stupid and he would never do that. He continues to talk and I look over to see candles lit at a window. I quickly blew them out so that he wouldn’t notice. They came back. I repeated this until I ran to a lever that hid the shop. All of the windows were now gone, replaced by wood. The man ran out back and we followed.
(Idk what happened next)
((THIS IS THE PART I REMEMBER DREAMING ABOUT BEFORE))
He gives in and starts talking about the town and his childhood. Under this shop, there was a huge cavern. As a kid, he and some townsfolk went down there (for some reason). All of a sudden, he found this girl around his age. She wore a gorgeous blue dress and bonnet with white trim. They talked and talked and they had a great time.
The town and he all had to escape the cavern and he begged the girl to come. He dragged her up all the scaffolding with the town. Just as they reached the door back into the shop, part of the scaffolding was gone. The town (already on the other side) tried to help but there wasn’t much they could do. He held onto her and she begged him to leave her here and he jumped successfully to the door. He said ‘We made it!’. But then the girl, still in his arms, said that she wasn’t finished here yet and like a snake slithered out of his arms and fell back into the cavern. The man said that he had stayed there for years hoping to finally be able to save that girl.
I and P both nodded toward each other and we went out the back door and began our climb down into the cavern, the man not far behind us. With our flashlights, we looked around for ages. Eventually, we found the girl who wore the same blue dress. The man was ecstatic and began to talk to her. All was well until all of a sudden she began to transform into this huge snake-like creature (with small legs and she was still wearing the dress). (I don’t remember why but) She began to attack us. Quickly, we ran back up the scaffolding and into the shop. She slithered her way up and partially through the door.

***
Shops are essentialy symbols for people.
When we come to earth we do so to pursue our purpose, develop and embody our gifts which we offer to each other hence the shop reference.
The manager usually refers to brain, so the brain is preoccupied with keeping the body alive (ie not falling asleep which effectively means to die in dream language)
P (this is probably your teaching guide) in the dream helps someone out of the shop - meaning helping someone cross over back to the spirit world. This is very important spiritual assistance and I believe the dream is telling you you can do this also.
People (souls) then go to another shop, meaning another incarnation.
When the shop closes (meaning the consciousness leaves the body), place looks dark and gloomy.
Reference to food/death (reminded me of artist Lyubov Panchenko death in Ukraine)

The second part whereby you have a choice to leave your shop in view or hide it, looks like a choice to offer your consciousness, light to others as a support when crossing over - like a 'ferry men'. You can do that during nightime sleep (with conscious commitment before going to bed).
But it seem there is warning that this entails travelling to places where death is present (war zones, nursing homes, hospice etc) which could have certain impact on a being.
Hiding the shop, replacing the windows with wood would be shielding away from this (protection boundaries). Window usually refers to clairvoyance /third eye, so that would be shut.
It s a deep dream and I suggest you ponder on the messages it s giving you especially since you had a similar dream before. Let me know if this makes sense.",2022-05-07 00:00:00,,,,,,

Being on the outlook for similarity and finding an external safety/
solution. But it could be other things... Our brains are always looking for patterns and even more so when we are in stress. Seeing the number 37 och 49 or 58 might have a different meaning as those lines of the numbers are quite unsymmetrical with eachother. It doesn't really form anything our brains can latch onto. But 11 does... I think we have to see them as a symmetrical shape to figure out what draws our brains to it.",2022-05-07 00:00:00,,,,,,

There was a small stream that ran alongside the road in front of the houses. One of the houses that was finished had a cheap green plastic netting as a fence, to keep a flock of chickens in the yard.

We went into one of the houses where there was more family. Everyone was sitting and eating. Inwas sitting next to my grandma and the uncle that lives with her and takes care of her. My dad said it was Skylers birthday (my cousin), so I said Happy Birthday Skyler at a loud volume since I was on the opposite side of the room from him. No one else said anything which I was surprised by. I heard someone say ""awkward"" under their breath.

I left the house with my cousin and siblings. We started down this path that lead into a narrow opening with gray stone cliffs on both sides. We stopped to rest and I noticed a wolf coming out from a hidden cave in the gray stone cliff. Everyone was scared and wolf seemed aggressive. Then more wolves started to come out, one by one, until we were surrounded. While everyone was freaking out, I noticed a small detail and that was thay they were not going to harm us. I stopped Everyone from attacking them. Then the wolves turned into sentient sheep thay had personal affects like bags and staffs and clothing. There were two groups of the sheep, mages and warriors. They started to return to the stone cliff and were grateful we didn't kill them and figured out the truth. My cousin couldn't see they were sheep and still tried to attack the last one. I sent him away and carried the last one, a mage, back to the wall. I looked in its eyes and talked with it, and it was very grateful. It was soft, fluffy, and light to carry.

I felt bad that no one else wished him a happy birthday. When he didn't see the truth about the sheep, I didn't have any strong feelings towards him, just trying to help. In real life I feel pretty neutral as well. He lives with my dad and siblings, he was kicked out of his own house as a teenager for getting a DUI. He is in his 20s now and started his own business but still lives with my dad, still finding his way in life",2022-05-05 00:00:00

The dream starts at a neighborhood under construction which I think means you are working on your own life and the relationships with others. Chickens being behind a plastic fence may have to do with anxious feelings being under control but the control seems a little flimsy or like it could be more robust. This links to the social awkwardness of you wishing your cousin a happy birthday. The birthday seems to be about you recognizing your cousin's maturing when others in the family aren't. This could also be recognizing how you have a new view about yourself and your own life choices. The family walk between the stone cliffs suggest that there's strong pressure in the family to follow a certain life path. The cliffs being gray gives me the feeling you are neutral about this family pressure and aren't really viewing it as good or bad. This is borne out in the wolf sheep interactions I think. People are initially fearful of the wolves or maybe those who appear to aggressively pursue their own goals. But then you realize the wolves arent harming anyone. In fact the wolves are sheep in the same flock (I think this references family or cousin's peers). There are warrior sheep and mages. The warriors are the risk takers and mages are those who I think have a deeper understanding of interpersonal dynamics like you do and are empathetic to your cousin's choices. The sheep could be a reference to the peer pressure people in the family have faced from peers or people in the family to confirm to expectations.,2022-05-05 00:00:00

I apologize for the delay in responding. Your interpretation is really insightful. There is pressure from my mom to confrom to social norms and she is estranged from the family. All of my siblings still live at home in their 20s. I actually gave up my bedroom to my cousin when he needed that place to go after his DUI, I was moving into my own place anyway. When I got home from work on Thursday after having this dream, I found out that my cousin has a nice new car. He has worked really hard to get to this point. I also just recently had to move back to my dads house to get back on my feet after a bad relationship, so I feel behind in life and set back. I am creating goals and working to move forward again. 🙏",2022-05-06 00:00:00

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream....

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?""). Share the whole dream.",2021-08-14 06:44:34,76.000000,25,0,1235650413623281,https://facebook.com/1235650413623281,100001027268137,Elisah Meis,"I personally would prefer is members would make it their standard to add the following information for a better, more personal explanation.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

Food= emotional and physical nourishment

refrigerator= to have this nourishment in ""cold storage"", to have this on hold or waiting

Bread=comfort and basic nourishment, many breads, something which seems comforting and basic nourishment, but is taking many varieties, options and forms

Sandwich= relationship where different people have closeness, might be 3 people ie two people who match (bread) who hold things together, and one in between who provides substance and content, this can be like a caregiver format such as two adults taking care of a child.

Sandwich also - close together, perhaps this is a nourishing closeness or perhaps this is a hasty and pressed together feeling closeness. The thought that the dream is about considering someone moving in might suggest that the pressing together of different people into relationship, or overlap of different areas of life, might feel overwhelming

The verb ""to sandwich"" - to squeeze things in, in a tight or restricted space or time, which can feel pressed or uncomfortable",2022-05-06 00:00:00,1416733222181665,https://facebook.com/1416733222181665,554421340,Nina Kaye,"The jail cell is also a restricted space - it can be a physical space, a metaphorical one such as placing restrictions on the self in rules or limitations...",2022-05-06 00:00:00

You can't be with her in real life, so your subconscious compensates this by allowing you to spend time with her in your dreams. It is sad when you wake up and find she's not really there, yeah. At that point, I think it will help to just cry it out. The dreams themselves are actually trying to help you process your emotions, because you're not processing them enough in real life. Instead of trying to stop it, it might be better to appreciate what it is trying to do for you. Thank your dream for allowing you to spend time with her. And for helping you process your feelings for her.

Add:
I'm also getting the sense that there is something you really regret. For one, it sounds like you regret not trying to be romantically involved with her. Two, that you two lost contact. And maybe... a similar situation is happening to you now in the present with someone else. Or something similar that has reminded and triggered you into thinking about her again.",2022-05-05 00:00:00,,,,,,

Its in regards to a girl I used to work with between 1998-2002. We were best friends and liked each other, were really close but nothing ever further occurred due to some additional factors. For me its upsetting dreaming about her with the frequency mentioned above. We lost contact in about 2007. All this time later I still dream about her. I don’t fully understand why and I actually wish it to stop. To be in her company 2-3 times a week for 5 years then wake up and lose her over n over is tiring for me. My question is what do my dreams of her mean (we are just together around other people in my dreams in various scenarios and I know in my dreams I feel happy) – why after all this time do I still dream of this, what does it mean and how can I make it stop as I don’t enjoy the sadness. Its got to the point where its upsetting me alot. Even when its the furthest thing from my mind and i havent thought about it, i still find myself having the dream.

She was a mirror for that something that already exists within you. Your subconscious knows you want that part of her that you love to be part of you and is expressing it through presentation in your dreams. I suggest asking for more specific information about that aspect of yourself you want to bring forth at night as you are going to sleep. Do this every night until you get an answer. Your subconscious has perfect memory and will give you an answer if you are persistent.,2022-05-06 00:00:00,,,,,,

I had made a decision to stop caring and to walk away. To let him make his mistake with his current situation cause he was choosing to believe a liar and a cheater. And so I wanted to not care. Right before going to bed.
I closed my eyes and it happened quickly.

My Dream.
I was in an apartment and in this dream, it was my apartment. I was with my kids and my daughter was watching something on TV. Then the front door opened, and I became afraid and then just felt anxious. I froze. I was shouting “get out, get out.”

I ran to the door, but I felt like I was going in slow motion. I pushed the door closed, locked the top and bottom nob. I even hooked the chain, but I had the sense…this feeling like I was doing something wrong. That I should not have been locking whoever it was out. I know it was a man behind the door. I heard the locks turning…he had a key like he had belonged there. He walks through the door. It felt like this was his place as well, I deep down kept saying get out…out…but I stood there staring at him. Like I was waiting for something. I felt like I was waiting for him to hold me. But I was frozen. He had black hair. I felt that I knew him, but he was a blur. I could not see his face. He stood there as if it was his home, it was our home. I looked at him like I didn’t know who he was, but I knew who he was, and I wanted to him to be there and hold me, but I kept thinking…Go…cause they always leave.",2022-05-06 06:29:26,0.000000,1,0,1416474718874182,https://facebook.com/1416474718874182,100023865227789,Rita Catherine,"The dream is showing you the truth of the matter, you’re afraid he will leave so you want to protect yourself by not caring.

Why would we both dream we were trying desperately to call each other but couldn't?",2022-05-06 13:44:54,,1,0,1416414235546897,https://facebook.com/1416414235546897,100007398103794,Hsin Jun,"Maybe you symbolise his support system and safe space in his dream. So when he feels that something bad has happened, he instinctually looks for you but because he feels helpless or stuck, the line doesn't connect and he doesn't get a relief from his negative feelings. He doesn't manage to feel safe.

And vice versa for you?

Or maybe because you guys are both stressed, you don't want to dump extra negative emotions on each other and thus by keeping it to yourself you feel unsupported and the dream manifested your inner feelings.

I'm just guessing, I'm not a dream expert 🤧",2022-05-06 00:00:00,1416425762212411,https://facebook.com/1416425762212411,539657750,Janet Colpo,Hsin Jun thank you!!! 😊,2022-05-06 00:00:00

When I got there she handed me a bag that had his cane (I don’t think he ever used a cane- I also couldn’t help thinking that he must have a lot of energy tied to his cane since he must’ve used it all the time) and like a red stuffed primitive star decoration. In a previous dream from a few nights ago I remember being at this same apartment except in this one it wasn’t my Pap’s, and I cleaned underneath the fridge and found a red stuffed star primitive magnet- just like the one my sister just gave me although hers wasn’t a magnet. I cleaned it off and put it into a basket of stuff for my sister. Now in the dream of this apartment being my Pap’s I give my sister the basket with the primitive star magnet in it and everything. Then I remember crying, a lot like drowning my face with tears, because of how much I miss my pap and how much it meant to have some of his items even if it was just a cane and some little stuffed thing.",2022-05-06 13:53:59,0.000000,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel this dream is a call for you to come into yoyr power.

The warrior is an archetypal figure that many of us dream of. He is the hero found in many stories. Brave, bold and confident. Able to tackle life's challenges and push through against all obstacles and opponents. He fights for truth, he stands against all that is ""bad"" in this world and stands up proudly for what he beleives is right.

The dream calls you to be the warrior in yoyr own life.

Living in the wild is about finding yoyr own sense of authenticity. To be who you are in your most natural state. Being unafraid and unashamed in your own sense of self, that who you are, what you beleive on and how you want to show the that to the world.

As you move into the position of the wild authentic warrior you may come across those who wish to attack you, to see you fail or knock you down. Because they themselves are challenged by your sense of pride and confidence in who you are. They will not want you to change, to move away from their controll or beleive about who you are or who you should be.

The gnomes show that you feel yourself to be ""bigger"" than them. They are no real threat to you when you stand in yoyr power, but they can cause some trouble so best to keep your distance. I feel you have given these people a taste of yoyr new found strength and confidence, but you do not seek to really hurt them.

"" I really tried to become more ruthless but it was hard"" I feel this is true of yoyr life right now. It is hard to move away from compliance and move towards agency. You do have to be ruthless, you have to put yourself and your own needs first.

I feel the baby shoes on the ground are a symbol of the immature steps you have taken in life on the road to maturity. Perhaps in the past others have had to clear up after you If you have made any bad decissions etc. Perhaps there is some clearing up for you to do now as you learn to deal with your own affairs. Once you have everything in order you will be better able to meet your own needs.

One idea to consider, others might offer alternative suggestions.",2022-05-04 00:00:00,,,,,,

I tried to feed them all, but weirdly, the place where I keep hamster’s food and treats, there was dog’s food.

So i have this fresh milk in the bottle and i got it from someone who claim its good quality. However (and for unknown reason) I've got the sudden feeling that this is not a pure milk but instead, a poisonous one. But even though i had that weird thought, I still bought it from the store because a friend of mine suddenly showed up and i dont want her to question the store's credibility too.

After buying the milk and losing my friend from the mall (since she also have errands to do), i quickly lined up on this another store and asked them to clean the bottle of the milk and scan the beverage for its ingredients or content. Suddenly, this friend of mine also popped up in this store and this time i have the feeling that she's suspicious of the milk's content too. Apparently when the lady that scanned the milk came back, she said that it's 90% milk content so, I quickly reasoned myself out to my friend and said that I just wanted to get the bottle cleaned but deep inside, I still doubt this and thought that I'll just throw it out once im home.

After exiting the mall and while walking down the street, i sensed this one man looking suspiciously at us. I grabbed my friend's hand and pulled her to walk faster and exit these streets but more numbers of men got up and chased us. We continuously ran until we reached this street where another group of men is waiting for us. And this time, I couldn't pull my friend to run anymore, she just stopped and stared at them this time.",2022-05-06 05:50:21,0.000000,1,0,1416026432252344,https://facebook.com/1416026432252344,690923262,Sara de Hond,"It seems what you think and do has consequences that you sometimes feel deeply responsible for.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?""). Share the whole dream.",2021-08-14 06:44:34,76.000000,25,0,1235650413623281,https://facebook.com/1235650413623281,100001027268137,Elisah Meis,"I personally would prefer is members would make it their standard to add the following information for a better, more personal explanation.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

It sounds like there is something you want to overcome or a goal you want to reach. But to get there, you have to climb up (work at it) this mountain (obstacle in your way). However, you don't believe you can do it. You think you'll slip, and so you do, every time. And when you do slip, there is no one there to catch you. You fall into a black oblivion, because you don't feel supported in your climb. You feel like you're on your own, and you don't believe you can do it.

I'd use this dream to tell myself to have more trust in myself, and faith in other people. And also, that climbing this mountain is very doable.",2022-05-05 00:00:00,1415830085605312,https://facebook.com/1415830085605312,1559324732,Richard Johnson,Annie Dai Great observations and advice.

Weird and gross, somewhat sexual in nature dream

My sister got surgery to turn her tongue into a penis. We were sitting in the car me and her in the backseat while my husband was driving. I kept wondering if she can taste anything now since she doesn't have any taste buds. And also if she regrets it. because it's a life long alteration to her body. I for some reason said to her. I guess your transgender? And she said no she's still a girl. And then I agreed since I guess it's only her tongue. And for some reason she ended up jerking off her tongue in the backseat of the car while I was there and hubby driving. But it was a literal explosion of cum after. I was so grossed out. Cause she had came all over me and some got in my mouth. And I got mad and said. That it was unconscentual sperm or something.and then got napkins to clean up.

Then we went to this place and my sister came with us. But she kept poking Out her dick tongue and I kept telling her to put it away, there could be children. Then she kinda disappeared. Me and my husband were having alot of fun and I was telling him we should come here more often. Things we're closing up and so we were getting ready to go, I went over to the trash to take gum out of my mouth, but for some reason no matter how much gum I took out of my mouth there was always gum in my mouth. Until there was a huge pile. And even then I still had gum so gave up. Which sucked cause the gum didn't even have flavor anymore and was gross.
I went to look for my sister and in one area there was a bunch of different displays, like museum artifacts. And I kept spinning this movable display and then all of a sudden I seen my sister dead in the case. It was more a flash of her head, and then this weird objects that symbolized her. I started crying cause she is gone, but also felt her tell me that she is at peace because she is paying her debt to society by being part of the display? But I still cried.

Weird and gross, somewhat sexual in nature dream

My sister got surgery to turn her tongue into a penis. We were sitting in the car me and her in the backseat while my husband was driving. I kept wondering if she can taste anything now since she doesn't have any taste buds. And also if she regrets it. because it's a life long alteration to her body. I for some reason said to her. I guess your transgender? And she said no she's still a girl. And then I agreed since I guess it's only her tongue. And for some reason she ended up jerking off her tongue in the backseat of the car while I was there and hubby driving. But it was a literal explosion of cum after. I was so grossed out. Cause she had came all over me and some got in my mouth. And I got mad and said. That it was unconscentual sperm or something.and then got napkins to clean up.

Then we went to this place and my sister came with us. But she kept poking Out her dick tongue and I kept telling her to put it away, there could be children. Then she kinda disappeared. Me and my husband were having alot of fun and I was telling him we should come here more often. Things we're closing up and so we were getting ready to go, I went over to the trash to take gum out of my mouth, but for some reason no matter how much gum I took out of my mouth there was always gum in my mouth. Until there was a huge pile. And even then I still had gum so gave up. Which sucked cause the gum didn't even have flavor anymore and was gross.
I went to look for my sister and in one area there was a bunch of different displays, like museum artifacts.

You feel this intimately (sexually) as if her problems are being cum-ed onto you. But you also care about her, because she is your sister. It's because you care so much about her that you feel her issues so intimately. Due to her inappropriate behaviors, you think she will end up ""dead"" somehow and pay for her obscenities by being on display. And of course you feel sad, because you love your sister.

I think the gum represents crap that you can't seem to get out of your mouth (or life). Much like the cum that your sister jerked out. It's sticky and it doesn't taste good.",2022-05-05 00:00:00,,,,,,

She was wearing a fleece hoodie and pleated jean skirt. The filmer told her to imitate an elephant so she sat down and did her best impression of an elephant trumpet. As she was trumpeting, as if through Photoshop, her head became an elephant's. A woman dressed like that in an elephant head is a common fantasy of mine so to see it translated into a dream was... Interesting to say the least.

Just last night, however, I dreamt I was following the same actress through a mall/theme park area. She was wearing her character, Penny's, waitress costume from The Big Bang Theory. I approached to compliment her outfit and she seemed slightly uncomfortable. I then proceeded to try and get a look up her skirt by waiting at the bottom of stairs and eventually saw her white panties. Seeing up a woman's skirt was a much bigger fantasy of mine when I was a teen, but as an adult I would never exhibit such behavior as in this dream.

Whether either of these have meaning outside of being my fantasies, I'm not entirely sure.",2022-05-05 00:00:00

It starts off with me being in a room and I keep calling people my ex husbands name.
The room that I'm in seems like a hotel room... its covered in a purplish pink velvet, floor to ceiling. I find a mysterious door that I knew had existed but just never found it until now. I open it up and look down, it's endless flights of stairs. The stairs are narrow but covered in the same coloured velvet, I start my decline and every so often I come to a platform thats a jump away from the stairs. It's like a viewing platform that has a door with lights on either side. I didn't want to jump over onto it to see what's behind the door. I continue down and finally the stairs leads me to a door, I open it and it's a room that has a musical instrument in it, I can't quite remember what sort but it was a magical one that would start playing. I walk across the room to the door infront of me and open it and its like I'm back at the beginning, it's more endless flights of stairs. I decend again, to come across another viewing platform that is a jump away from the stairs that has a single door with lights on either side, identical to the last one.

So this is two separate dreams, 2 days in a row.

Im inside my house and I see masked figures outside slamming into the windows of my house. Over and over again. I was so mad a found a large stick/staff and went outside to find them hiding around the side of my house. It was an inspector I sometimes use (who I get along great with) and a few others I did not recognize. I was very dissatisfied and upset and threatened to hurt them and they left after I shared my distaste.

The next day I was in my living room and noticed water damage coming through all of the walls/ceiling (some context last year we had some water leaks and it left our house cut open for the better part of 8 months waiting for contractors that in itself was a nightmare) as I looked closer at the walls I noticed they almost looked like they were molding or looked very old and cracking with scars on the walls, I looked up to the top left and there was a large, almost demonic alien full head/face imprinted in the wall, like as if the face was inside the wall pushing out. It had a very large cranium and smaller mouth comparable to an alien, this shit was scary looking. To my wife I said wtf is that! I then noticed halloweeny decorations all around the house and at that point I lost it and said babe did you put these decorations up?? She said no. All of a sudden a giant owl flew smacking straight into the window glass with force, I immediately ran outside to find I was in a cul de sac and the owl was hanging in front of the window connected to a long clothes line that was attached to a home across the street.
I was so pissed and as I walk up to the house, the same people from the dream before came out with masks holding swords and approached me, I was able to disarm a sword from one of the three men, this time I didn’t recognize any of them. I realized the swords were wooden, then I remember waking myself up yelling we need to lock the doors.

I’ll never forget that dream 🙃",2022-05-04 16:43:51,0.000000,1,0,1415409352314052,https://facebook.com/1415409352314052,100023865227789,Rita Catherine,"You may be feeling moody, and would like to be left alone.

The roller coaster ride may be the emotions you feel, and the chair lift going up high could be the improvement you see in him. You may be feeling enthusiastic about his progress. Not being able to get rid of his things could mean holding on to something...may
be a belief that he could do it.

In the dream I was on someone social media (tok tok) live. In the dream, I joined in and pretty much felt like I wasn’t wanted there in the live at all. I was only asking were they related to some people that I know. Then I remember seeing a “mentioned” in the notification with my name, but the video ended up not talking about me at all. I remember hearing the guy talking about my mother in law but these were were the same people that had the same married last name as her. However they weren’t related at all, The guy was explaining to everyone on tiktok live that my mother in law had two sons, one 37, and passed away but he wasn’t married. So I started seeing different people with the same last name but they weren’t related to each other at all. I was only trying to see if the girl in the video was the girl who married my cousin (who is still alive) but she says that wasn’t her.",2022-05-04 13:13:13,0.000000,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

So some qualities that this person represents are being integrated

He's just a nice guy, he's married, I've known him for 17 years. Never really spoke much to him until recently as he's dove down some rabbit holes and I guess he started chatting to me about it because he knows I'm into it.
The sex was good, we knew we shouldn't be doing it but we gave into temptation and did. We were sort of sitting together, kind of in a half cuddle, and we were both thinking this is wrong, but his cock went hard and then we had sex.

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?"").

It looked like a thin chicken bone not an actual nose bone. But I was babysitting and I had the kids drive me to the ER and the dr took a knife and and peeled back my skin to put the bone back. I was awake. It was the strangest feeling/ dream I’ve had. After like 10 minutes of the dr digging around to put the bone back up there I woke up bc my conscious was like get me tf out of here lmfao 🤣,2022-05-04 19:06:06,0.000000,1,0,1414554759066178,https://facebook.com/1414554759066178,1317912160,Lauren Wemmer,"Weird dreams are the best, lol. I think your dream could be that you were looking at the ""bare bones"" of your feelings as nose can equate to intuitive sense. That the bone looked like a chicken bone might be examining your fears more closely. Maybe getting the bone put back in after digging around might be you found your feelings were warranted after you really delved into the matter. That's my guess but there can be many interpretations
that could fit.",2022-05-04 00:00:00,,,,,,

Background: I dated someone in 2015. The person broke up with me out of nowhere, when things were going pretty well. Over the phone, mind you.

We were both young and this person wasn’t ready to settle down. This person was perfectly decent and I cared for them a lot, at the time.

I was heartbroken, but I moved on.

This person reached out to me in 2016 to apologize, but I immediately cut them off, and respectfully told them I was doing great, had moved on and wasn’t interested in their apology, friendship or otherwise. I wished them a beautiful life, sincerely and wholeheartedly.

Fast forward to last week. This person comes to me in a dream.

We are in the same place, they wave at me to get my attention.

I tell them “Hi, nice to see you but I can’t talk. I’m late to pick up my kid from daycare.”

They keep saying something I can’t understand, and I’m in a rush and get to my car. I then find the car has been hit / is dented and the tires are flat. This person is gone and I’m stuck there.

*I wake up.*

The next morning, out of curiosity, I type their name on Facebook and after some digging, I find out they died unexpectedly last summer. Young, seemingly healthy person. Poof gone.

Now, I’m here feeling sad and spooked.

While waiting for the doctor I was able to pull out 2 bullets on my own ( they were .22 c) and then the doctor walked in while I was doing so and just laughed and jumped in to finish.

However you aren't fearful about or afraid of being wounded. The bullets might represent what is wounding you. The different caliber bullets might be symbolizing some wounds are more significant than others. The numbers associated with the calibers could be significant to the dream meaning. Two might be related to a partnership. Four symbolizes stability and 5 is the number of change and freedom. You might feel that while you are capable you might need some professional help to heal/move past some of those wounds.,2022-05-04 00:00:00,1414469925741328,https://facebook.com/1414469925741328,1155550808,Rebecca Griffith,"Lauren Wemmer dang, that’s pretty dang deep and actually makes sense.

Especially from this, the blood, guts, helpless suffering, is your body trying to get your attention. If you're waking up gagging it's very possible you're having acid reflux while you're sleeping and your body is trying to wake you up. Since this is a recurring thing, I would look into it. There are also other issues that occur while sleeping like sleep apnea and what not, but the gagging thing really sounds like reflux",2022-05-04 00:00:00,1414390609082593,https://facebook.com/1414390609082593,562038109,Val Goniwiecha Alcorn,If you do feel like this could be the issue.

I have been having this recurring dream for about a month now. It's gotten to the point where I have trouble sleeping and I wake up gagging. There is a brown horse and he's eating. This is in the middle of a huge city. He's eating a beagle puppy. There's blood and guts and u can see muscles. I can also here the puppy crying and moving. I don't do anything I just watch until I wake up. If anyone has any insight I would appreciate!",2022-05-04 08:21:25,0.000000,3,0,1414431425745178,https://facebook.com/1414431425745178,1317912160,Lauren Wemmer,"I would interpret this as similar to what Amanuel Solomon has said. For me horses tend to symbolize freedom and/or service to others. Stallions can symbolize male sexuality. The color brown I would link to the earth element, which to me would reinforce the idea of the horse representing service. The beagle puppy evokes a sense of happiness, innocence and family devotion. The dream might have to do with a busy life (big city) grounded in service to others is eating alive/killing your chances of being devoted to family or feelings of innocence and carefree happiness. The blood and guts and muscle might be gore accompanying the service or could be that the emotional situation is having negative physical effects on you or a family member. Since this is a recurring dream the situation is ever present for you and something that you may need to consciously come to terms with.",2022-05-04 00:00:00,,,,,,

Second.... We were in a house, but it wasn't my house. A storm was coming and my husband and son went to the backyard to secure things and I went to the front yard. I came in and was looking out the back window.... Tornado like Winds we're whipping everything around. My favorite cherry tree was there and a lot bigger than my real life one.... The wind bent my tree right over and I kept thinking it's so flexible it's not breaking.... And then it snapped in half. I was upset but I kept telling myself I can plant a new one. I looked over and y neighbors half built shed was ripped up, my husband was sitting next to pikes of debris exhausted but alive. My son was also tossed around but ok...... And then I woke up 🤷🏻‍♀️.

I'm new. I had a nightmare.
I dreamt that I had a venomous snake inserted into my groin area by my hip, against my will. I was supposed to fight something or someone, or maybe both. I remember feeling it move under my skin. It burrowed under my skin. I tried to escape but the snake would sliver out and bare it's fans. It's very lower half still within me. I thought it was a rattlesnake at first, but wasn't, some other venomous thing. I could see the drops of Venum dripping from it's teeth. It would snap at me, strike at me. In one instance it bit, injecting me with a small amount of venom. It didn't kill me in the dream but made me more compliant. I can't remember many details. I remember a man, I remember a hallway in an abandoned building, I think a school maybe. I remember the sun and how it was blindingly bright even in the building it shine through. It seem to be out in a desert maybe? There was dust and dirt everywhere, I could even smell it. I could feel it all, the heat, the dust mixed sweat plastered to my face. It was the stink of war. It felt like there was some kind of battle that was going on but I didn't know why or for what reason. And I was being forced to fight. I was terrified. It was horrible and then I woke up.

I still feel sick to my stomach from it. Can't get it out of my head.

But the conflict might not be clear cut. It could be in a relationship especially in relation to sexuality as the snake is a strong fertility symbol, and considering its location... So in that context it could be framing pregnancy as a means to control you contrasted against abandonment (abandoned building) issues. ie the conflict might be internal between these issues.

But then again the snake is a symbol of kundalini energy that is supposed to be stored in the base chakra at the base of the spine, so it could be related to that and creatove/

He looked at me in the rear view mirror and smiling he asked if I was comfortable. I said I was. He had a relatively kind smile. But he didn't turn around at the end of the street. He kept going.

He drove right into a giant garbage dump. The garbage was almost up to the door handle of the car and I knew I was in trouble. That's when I saw a brown and white spotted rat.

I can usually figure out what my dreams are about and why I dream them. Not the dream last night. Also, sometimes some of my dreams just don't seem significant. But last night's dream did. I really hope someone can help me figure out what I'm supposed to know. Here's the dream:

I was somewhere, a house maybe, with my husband getting ready to leave so we called an uber. The car came and the driver seemed a little nervous. I just figured he was a new driver. I got in and my husband hadnt come out yet.

. The guy started driving and I was a little concerned because my husband hadnt gotten in. But I reasoned the driver was just going to turn around at the end of the street.

He looked at me in the rear view mirror and smiling he asked if I was comfortable. I said I was. He had a relatively kind smile. But he didn't turn around at the end of the street. He kept going.

He drove right into a giant garbage dump. The garbage was almost up to the door handle of the car and I knew I was in trouble. That's when I saw a brown and white spotted rat. It jumped in the car and into my lap. Of course I was freaking out and it seemed the driver's intention was having me be attacked by rats. But with all my courage I grabbed the rat with both hands and angrily started poking it in the driver's face. I was filled with anger and fear. It didn't faze him. He just sort of chuckled.

This was a nightmare.
I saw 2 bodies wrapped in plastic. A man was dragging them as if to bury them.
I then was talking to a lady. I asked her how is ur Aunty?. She said she was fine and that she had seen her a few days ago.
I knew she was lying as 1 of the bodies was the Aunty.

this aunt has and that might tell you something about what you yourself are trying to get rid of.

I have a reoccurring dream about the man who used to molest me as a teenager and I need help to understand what it means, I feel like there has to be a reason I keep having it.

I dream that I’m back in my childhood bedroom. It’s not the only bedroom I had in childhood, but it is the one in the home we shared with him, and the room I had through my most formative years. The room is barren, but I’m painting it a baby blue color. Suddenly I notice he’s in the room with me; I’m not sure when he came in, but when I turn around he’s painting over my blue with a dark red. I start screaming “Stop! Can’t you see I’m trying to paint it blue? Why can’t you see that? Stop!” He ignores me, and suddenly the bat I used to play softball with in the time I lived there is in my hands. I start hitting him with it, and I’m crying and saying “Please stop painting it red, I’m trying to paint it blue.” I can feel the resistance of my bat hitting him, I’m swinging as hard as I can, but I never see it hurting him. He continues to standing facing away from me as I hit him.

And that’s where the dream always ends and I wake up having cried in reality during my sleep.",2022-05-02 10:01:23,2.000000,12,0,1412062022648785,https://facebook.com/1412062022648785,560345596,Alexandra Moulding,"Hi, firstly I am so sorry this man hurt you and that you are still suffering in this way.

My thoughts are that the dream is calling you to do some further work.

Being in the room you shared tells me that the dream is about the mindset you occupy around this issue.

There are allways many threads to the symbols and lots of different ways to approach them. My interpretation is just one suggestion.

It seems the room has been cleared in preparation of remodelling and renovation. Your psyche needs an update in some way.

Yet you used the word ""barren"" so it may also be that this space internally has become a barren and empty place for you. I wonder if you have tried to clear away the issue in some way, or you just want to paint it over and cover up what happened. Maybe that's something you tried to do when you were young.

Baby blue suggests an innocence. A colour we might paint for a new baby's room. Blue is the colour of the throat chakra, the centre of ouf communication, it invites us to talk and express ourselves, especially verbally. It's also a colour of peace and tranquillity.

I feel that the painting is a way of saying i want to start again. I want to prepare for a new beginning, to clear away the old and welcome in the new. The colour is ""light"" and invights those themes too.

But the man seems to have too much power because he is allways able to undo your efforts. Red is a very emotive colour bringing thems of lust, passion, danger and anger.

I feel the scene is describing what occupies your mental space over the issue. It seems he is still able to take over and ""colour"" things. Im sure this experience in many ways has ""coloured"" or informed the rest of your life, perhaps with a darkness.

Your asking him to stop is very possative because you recognise the unwanted and ongoing influence in your life.

But your pleas and physical attempts to make it stop are not working. And I feel this probably the crux of it. It's very very sad and unfair, this man violated you when you were a powerless. He broke the law, the trust of your family and broke every sacred boundary that is held by good decent loving people. The softball racquet I feel represents your efforts as a child who mearly did not have the power to make it stop by her own efforts. That was not your fault and I feel the dream is repeating because it wants to call you forward as the adult you now are. It's replaying this internal video because its still playing out in various ways within you. You need to address the issue to get the dream to change and hopefully stop.

If this were my dream I would look towards finding a good psychotherapist
and begin by bringing them the dream. There is obviously a lot of pent up emotion that is being held within you.

The painting shows that you want to start over. Painting your own childhood room and the location of your pain, suggests you want to welcome the child who you were. She still lives within you, painting her room in a new and fresh way invites healing and saftey and a way to refresh yourself for a new start. I feel a psychotherapist
will be able to help you with this. Make sure it's not a councellor though as they wont have the expertise. You need someone trained in dealing with these specific traumas.

I agree with her on almost every point. I would add that trying to cover the walls with baby blue is a sign of you wishing to put it all behind you with a new idea represented by baby. Baby blue is a mixture of blue and white. Blue is the color of wisdom and white is the color of spirituality. Your molester is a mental aspect of yourself that you are trying to clear out. I would suggest asking yourself for an answer on how to remove that aspect by telling yourself that you want to know how to remove it as you are going to sleep. Do this every night until you get an answer. Your subconscious will provide the answer for you.,2022-05-02 00:00:00

I wonder if you have tried to clear away the issue in some way, or you just want to paint it over and cover up what happened. Maybe that's something you tried to do when you were young.

Baby blue suggests an innocence. A colour we might paint for a new baby's room. Blue is the colour of the throat chakra, the centre of ouf communication, it invites us to talk and express ourselves, especially verbally. It's also a colour of peace and tranquillity.

I feel that the painting is a way of saying i want to start again. I want to prepare for a new beginning, to clear away the old and welcome in the new. The colour is ""light"" and invights those themes too.

But the man seems to have too much power because he is allways able to undo your efforts. Red is a very emotive colour bringing thems of lust, passion, danger and anger.

I feel the scene is describing what occupies your mental space over the issue. It seems he is still able to take over and ""colour"" things. Im sure this experience in many ways has ""coloured"" or informed the rest of your life, perhaps with a darkness.

Your asking him to stop is very possative because you recognise the unwanted and ongoing influence in your life.

But your pleas and physical attempts to make it stop are not working. And I feel this probably the crux of it. It's very very sad and unfair, this man violated you when you were a powerless. He broke the law, the trust of your family and broke every sacred boundary that is held by good decent loving people. The softball racquet I feel represents your efforts as a child who mearly did not have the power to make it stop by her own efforts. That was not your fault and I feel the dream is repeating because it wants to call you forward as the adult you now are. It's replaying this internal video because its still playing out in various ways within you. You need to address the issue to get the dream to change and hopefully stop.

If this were my dream I would look towards finding a good psychotherapist
and begin by bringing them the dream. There is obviously a lot of pent up emotion that is being held within you.

The painting shows that you want to start over. Painting your own childhood room and the location of your pain, suggests you want to welcome the child who you were. She still lives within you, painting her room in a new and fresh way invites healing and saftey and a way to refresh yourself for a new start. I feel a psychotherapist
will be able to help you with this. Make sure it's not a councellor though as they wont have the expertise. You need someone trained in dealing with these specific traumas.

I have a reoccurring dream about the man who used to molest me as a teenager and I need help to understand what it means, I feel like there has to be a reason I keep having it.

I dream that I’m back in my childhood bedroom. It’s not the only bedroom I had in childhood, but it is the one in the home we shared with him, and the room I had through my most formative years. The room is barren, but I’m painting it a baby blue color. Suddenly I notice he’s in the room with me; I’m not sure when he came in, but when I turn around he’s painting over my blue with a dark red. I start screaming “Stop! Can’t you see I’m trying to paint it blue? Why can’t you see that? Stop!” He ignores me, and suddenly the bat I used to play softball with in the time I lived there is in my hands. I start hitting him with it, and I’m crying and saying “Please stop painting it red, I’m trying to paint it blue.” I can feel the resistance of my bat hitting him, I’m swinging as hard as I can, but I never see it hurting him. He continues to standing facing away from me as I hit him.

I see the painting of the room as you setting out your life and goals and making plans for what your life will look like. Him painting over your blue I think represents how his actions have changed the colour of your experience. I think the meaning of the colours is significant too, blue being a safe and peaceful colour vs the red representing violence and anger and negativity. Your act of hitting him not affecting him I think probably represents your retaliation to the trauma he put you through and feeling like even if you fight back it’s not going to be effective. I think the reason you’re having this dream is to process the loss of childhood and innocence and control over life.

above are beautiful. I think this sounds useful, what has been said. To add to this is the dream image of a bedroom can mean one's own privacy, one's own unconscious, and one's view of sexuality. Which he has given you a darker view of these things than you naturally would have. Softball means you are not ""playing hardball"" you do not feel that you were tough enough about what happened to you.

I am going to make a suggestion of what to do which was advice my mother gave to me when I was a child and would have the same nightmares over and over.

She told me, before I go to sleep, to tell myself about the monsters ""i am not afraid of you!"" She said if anything is chasing you in a dream, to turn around and face it ""you don't scare me, you can't hurt me, I am not afraid of you!"" And it will be less scary once you face it. I think this is true in waking life working through c-ptsd triggers, and it is true in dreams as well.

If you keep hitting him with the bat in the dream, see if you can try having any awareness in the dream that you can try something else. You could try ""this is my room. You are not allowed in here""

Or simply ""you don't hurt me, you can't scare me, I am not afraid of you""

Because he turns his back on you in the dream, and because also about how others commented on ""painting over"" can mean to try to cover or conceal the surface, it makes me think that the dream is about ""facing him""

You can do this in a dream, by looking into his face and telling him ""you can't hurt me anymore I am not afraid of you""

But as mentioned, you can do this in therapy or journaling.

There is an option where you could ask a therapist about ""role play"" the idea of the therapist standing in for this abuser while you tell him what it is you need to say to him.

You can also do this with mental rehearsal of conversations and or with letters

A ""confrontation fantasy"" which is either imagined, or played out in therapy, or that eventually actually happens in real life - this is a huge part of healing from sexual abuse 💖

Much love to you in your healing journey 💙💜 the fact that you are having the dream is showinghow strong and resilient that you truly are, that you are recovering and gaining strength and working through this. It sounds like you are at a close point to having a breakthrough and that's why your mind is nudging you with these dreams

There is no way out, but through 💙 keep going and you will get there! 💚",2022-05-02 00:00:00,,,,,,

The room is barren, but I’m painting it a baby blue color. Suddenly I notice he’s in the room with me; I’m not sure when he came in, but when I turn around he’s painting over my blue with a dark red.

For me, baby blue is a light color of blue and is a mixture of blue and white. In my thirty plus years of dreaming and interpreting, blue is the color of wisdom and white is the color of spirituality. Red is the color of emotion and since it is a dark red, it would be a very deep emotion which would be understandable in this dream.

I have had the best luck and pricing finding a therapist through a therapy school, where the teacher will do an initial interview with you and consider which one of the students is a best match with you. Also though there is a lot of online therapy options now which might feel easier than in person. There are other options too, like group therapy, or taking courses - sometimes these are offered at community centres or through hospitals and clinics or even churches, and may be offered for free or affordable. There can be options too like art therapy, if talk therapy is not helping as much. Or because trauma is stored in the body, yoga can help. Yoga, massage, and also mindfulness and meditation. There are a lot of youtube videos and free resources of these type of options. It sounds like the dream is coming up because you feel stronger and able to look at the issue for healing. That is amazing 💖 if you do try talk therapy, keep in mind that for the first little while, month or couple of months, you might feel worse. And then it gets a lot better than you have felt before! It is similar to like the gym workouts, if you are out of shape the new fitness routine is super hard on your body and you feel extra tired and achy. But then you grow muscle! And you have stamina! It is like that when you start therapy. You are digging through a lot of past issues, it might be that they were lying dormant for a while. It is unpleasant and uncomfortable and first. And then it gets so much better. So if you do it, dont be afraid if at first it feels hard. It gets so much better! If you stick with it for a while 💙 thanks so much for sharing your dream in the group",2022-05-03 00:00:00

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:47:26,1235685116953144,https://facebook.com/1235685116953144,100001037053553,Terry Dey,Elisah Meis I agree but we've noticed many of our dreamers arent always English proficient because its not their primary language so sometimes we have to work with it,2021-09-08 14:47:41

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:47:26,1235686206953035,https://facebook.com/1235686206953035,100001027268137,Elisah Meis,Thats true... however a bit more info would be extremely helpful.,2021-09-08 14:47:42

It was like I was back in another time and men were very domineering over women, it seemed like the men were treating their women like slaves and they were getting paid for it, like a pension. Even though the men were working, they were getting some extra cash from the government for having a wife but the women were unaware of this injustice. It was like they were imprisoned in their own homes.
So I walked into a house and started demanding that the women be set free and aware of what was going on. It wasn’t about breaking up a marriage, it was more about giving them some freedom, I just sensed a mass injustice. This guy was trying to overpower me so I basically told him I will absolutely beat the crap out of him if he keeps doing this. He was being a smart arse so I grabbed him and started punching him in the face and then his wife was free.
I then followed her and then we kissed.

Next moment I was somewhere looking at some cycle, like it was repeating itself and I said to my son about things never change! I wish I could remember the details more but it was like I kept seeing the same things

Now makes me wonder if I did something in history and now I’m paying for it 🤔",2022-05-03 00:26:54,0.000000,1,0,1413193272535660,https://facebook.com/1413193272535660,100023865227789,Rita Catherine,"It could just simply be a reflection of what you see going on in society and thinking that it’s like old patterns never change, they just keep recycling.",2022-05-03 00:00:00,1413524619169192,https://facebook.com/1413524619169192,100025634782553,Paula Coker,Rita Catherine thanks,2022-05-03 00:00:00

Saturday night around 10/11pm I was quite irritated I wasn’t falling asleep since I had a lot to do as soon as my feet hit the floor Sunday morning. I had been laying there for quite some time with my eyes closed. I opened my eyes (without my glasses mind you) and saw what looked like a Black Sea urchin but with not as many spikes and very wiggly. It was RIGHT infront of my face. I gasped and leaned back away from it. I watched it for about 30 seconds move. It slowly made it way to a shadow on the wall almost like it was hiding just out of sight in the shadow. I closed my eyes obviously and willed it away I suppose. I rolled over and forced myself to sleep. But man oh man what the hell was that?

I have been a sufferer of sleep paralysis and have also done my research on Hypnagogic hallucinations. I had a occurrence earlier in the year that was very similar to this but it was a swarm of beetles flying and crawling into the upper door way of my bedroom. The night before this recent occurrence, my four year old son woke up talking about dreaming of beetles. Maybe that part is a coincidence. But, please leave me your thoughts.

Saturday night around 10/11pm I was quite irritated I wasn’t falling asleep since I had a lot to do as soon as my feet hit the floor Sunday morning. I had been laying there for quite some time with my eyes closed. I opened my eyes (without my glasses mind you) and saw what looked like a Black Sea urchin but with not as many spikes and very wiggly. It was RIGHT infront of my face. I gasped and leaned back away from it. I watched it for about 30 seconds move. It slowly made it way to a shadow on the wall almost like it was hiding just out of sight in the shadow. I closed my eyes obviously and willed it away I suppose. I rolled over and forced myself to sleep. But man oh man what the hell was that?

I have been a sufferer of sleep paralysis and have also done my research on Hypnagogic hallucinations. I had a occurrence earlier in the year that was very similar to this but it was a swarm of beetles flying and crawling into the upper door way of my bedroom.

Every night before bed for the first 2 months after my mom's death I would manifest that I wanted to see her in my dreams. She only appeared a few times though. Now every night I can't help but think of how much I miss her right before falling asleep, not manifesting anything & now I dream of her almost daily...
Half of the times the dreams are the same thing. She died but then somehow she came back to life. But somehow I knew she was going to die again so I would call or text her frequently to check up on her to make sure she's okay but I was always scared when she didn't respond...sometimes it took her weeks to respond (in real life she was the opposite).

Why am I so scared of loosing her again even though she's already gone?",2022-05-03 15:13:11,,1,0,1413308022524185,https://facebook.com/1413308022524185,560345596,Alexandra Moulding,"I'm so sorry you mum has died. In my opinion not all the dreams we have of our departed loved ones are visitations. This series of dreams you are having, to me, feel like greif dreams. If you had spent a long time asking her to appear in your dreams, and usually focus on your sorrow before sleep, then there's probably a lot for the dreaming mind to work through. Its not unusual to dream soon after loss that our loved ones never really died, or that they have come back to life. Its so unbeleivable they have gone, we miss them so much and it takes time for the heart and soul to come to terms with the fact they have passed on. It seems you are dreaming that you can communicate with her which is probably something you wish you could still do, and is indded the purpose of your manifestation request. I feel the part where she dosnt respond to your messages is the dreams attempt to help you adjust to the fact that she has gone.

If you find the dreams upsetting you can ask the dream to help you accept your loss in another way. Perhaps you could ask your mum to show her loving spirit in other ways too.

Sending you my warmest condolences x",2022-05-03 00:00:00,,,,,,

Soon after, a great prehistoric-looking water creature showed up and the creature's minions forced her to get eaten while I could do nothing to save her. Feeling horrible, I moped about for a while until I obtained help from my family and a scientist. Together, we searched for solutions on how to go back in time and save her. We eventually did just that destroying the creature in the process. However, no matter what we did, there was always something off about the timeline.

The girl may be representing your emotions that are eating you up and you’re feeling helpless to do anything about it. You’re looking for a solution to this. The scientist may represent trying to be more logical and less emotional. Going back in time may mean reviewing the past and what happened back then.

I was at my house after work with friends hanging out. There was string in one of their hairs, so I started pulling it out. Then, her hair started coming with it. It was like 3 feet of her hair, although it wasn't that long. We talked about how weird it was, but didn't think much of if.i asked if I should just throw it away, admiring how soft and thick it was.

As we were having this conversation, we heard a vehicle driving around making frequent stops and getting closer. As the vehicle approaches and stops, I get a weird feeling and quickly throw the hair in the trash. My friend was sitting on the front stairs of the porch, and I was right inside the door with the other friend in the kitchen. .

I hear this man ask if my friend is ""Danielle"". This is my daughter's name and she says yes. (Somehow in this dream she changed people). He walks over and asks her to go with him. He is a super creep. I ask h8m to leave and he sits and keeps talking. I ask my other friend to get my g.un, she does.

I've asked him to leave again, but doesn't and is closer. I have it ready to go and pointed. As my friend asks if I'm OK, I said yes and the accidentally pulled the tri.g.g.er kill ing him .

The next scene, my daughter is gone, the guy was in a printer machine, like folded up and it seems that that is where he was when the prior event happened. My friend had turned into a different friend and we were trying to figure out the best way to dispose 9f it...

Yet another vivid dream. That's 2 days in a row now. This one has more of an obvious meaning but there's still some gaps that are missing for me.

My mum, my dad and my sister went to the library for research on something (can't remember what). Only me and my sister were allowed in because of Covid for some reason, so mum and dad went back to the car outside.

My sister and I sat at a computer. It was odd because she was around 6 years old in my dream, but she's coming up to 12 years old soon in reality. She was acting very mature and I don't know if it's relevant or not but she had a terrible cold, that of course I was worried was Covid. We got on very well and I looked after her like a parent would their own child.

Suddenly, I'm rushing to get back to the car but my sister was no longer there. I lose my phone somewhere and I'm freaking out massively. I really needed my phone and I felt incredibly unsafe without it.

Now I'm at my mum's and going through loads of bags to try and find my phone. I went upstairs in a panic and found my dad drinking in secret. *In reality my dad is an alcoholic but has been sober (at least that's what he tells me) since being in hospital in December last year* I was so angry and I started screaming at him, telling him how selfish he is and that he knows what will happen if he keeps going.

I went back downstairs, because I was done with him, and had a message waiting for me (I'm assuming on someone else's phone) saying that they had my phone and was bringing it round.

I answer the door and find a man in a mask. He hands me a white iPhone, which I know isn't mine but I take it anyway. I go to close the door and he pulls out a small knife that he proceeds to hold against my rib cage.
""You're not even going to pay me for that phone"" he says.
I scream and my dad appears. I tell him this guy has got a knife on me but my dad doesn't seem to do anything.

It's a bit blurry at this point, but somehow the man gets stabbed to death. I'm not sure if I did it or what. I find out by the police that he was a very dangerous serial killer and has brutally murdered and disemboweled hundreds of women, of which they showed me photos. It was very disturbing.

Now I'm standing near some railings overlooking the sea. There are some people around me and one person calls my number. I find my phone at the bottom of my bag and I lose control of my emotions.
I look up to the sky and thank God, over and over again, for allowing me to find my phone. I was hysterical and couldn't breathe, clutching onto the railings as I sobbed.

I'm still crying in my mum's living room. I pulled out the iPhone from earlier and noticed it belonged to someone called Kate. I put a post on FB trying to find her so I could give her the phone back. Then I was told that she was one of the man's victims.

Again, I lose control of my emotions and wonder why all of this was happening.

Then I wake up.

The loss of the phone could be representing the loss of being able to communicate all of your feelings and what is going on with you.

Being disemboweled may relate to “spilling your guts”, if you’ve tried to communicate your feelings over and over again.

This morning I dreamt I was waking up and started bleeding, like a period. There’s not much more to the dream than that. I wiped on toilet paper and was so disappointed.

Real life: I accidentally conceived an unplanned baby. We decided to keep it, but lost it on 4/20/22 due to miscarriage at 7 weeks. Now we are planning to conceive again. We’ve “baby danced” twice since the bleeding stopped. I felt a tiny bit of cramping yesterday. Maybe ovulation? I’ve read ovulation could happen as soon as 14 days after miscarriage, but it would only be day 12 yesterday. I also woke up with bad headache this morning.

restore itself but do look it up. Probably best to allow yourself some time and prioritise yourself.

Apparently the recommendation used to be to wait for three months, but that has changed, and now there’s no evidence suggesting it’s necessary to wait, and in fact, supposedly you’re more fertile in those first three months after a miscarriage. But who knows, because science changes!

But I have seen to wait at least one cycle if you’ve gotten a d&c. Thank you, again!",2022-05-03 00:00:00

This one dream I can't seem to shake.

I died in my sleep. I was a spirit. There was someone talking to me. I don't recall seeing what it looked like. The feeling I had is so hard to describe as I've never felt something like it. There was no pain, no worrying, no fear. Just calm, relaxing and pure peace. I don't feel like my description justify how wonderful it actually felt. The voice asked if I was ready to move on.

When they have children I will be here for them too. Shortly after this I woke up. The feeling of complete peace lingered in my body. I was happy, relaxed and calm when I woke up.

It's straight forward about you making a choice about staying or going. I just added that you were given a choice and I added the part where I see it as you had a choice and it's a fork in your path. I know you expressed that you didn't see it that way. Not a decision but an affirmation for you that you are staying. There spiritually must be a reason that you were offered this choice. It could have karmic purpose. You may have settled all your karmic business and didn't need to stay. You don't mention anything concerning this. You potentially could have been offered this because you don't have anything to fulfill spiritually. You may have been given this choice because of that. I could be totally off in my opinion here. You are the ultimate judge of that for yourself. A lot of souls are given a fork in their path. This is the first dream that I have seen presented here on this page where this subject is brought up. How many given the opportunity to go and choose to go is unknown. I have heard people say in speaking of near death experience where illness or accident speak of a choice given. Freewill exists and you made a decision.",2022-05-03 00:00:00

Part of this is because we stayed in the relationship, so we were accepting those comments, in some way, it got internalized, like ""maybe their criticisms are correct""

I think if your ex shows up in your dreams, it is a symbol of someone you KNOW not to listen to, you KNOW is negative and doesn't want the best for you, you KNOW you want this negativity out of your life.

Therefore, if your ex shows up in dreams complaining about you, it can be a sign of:

1. In waking life, you are being accepting and welcoming of someone else's negativity. You can find a way to cut this down or to stand up for yourself, if you have this situation to deal with

2. That you have been having negative thoughts about yourself, and you know those aren't true, so it is time to cut that out and be lovelier and sweeter to yourself 💜

My two cents Ali Pinlac it doesn't mean this person is coming back in your life, it means they represent a symbol of criticism which you know is overly harsh, and something in your waking life is reminding you of that.",2022-05-02 00:00:00,,,,,,

Let me start by saying, I am 51 yrs old now. Many yrs ago, my family lived in a neighborhood with alot of kids. We only lived there for 2 yrs and during that time, I was 14 and 15 yrs old. There was a boy who had a huge crush on me, I will call him john. I was a bit of a tomboy and i didn't have the same feelings for him. To me he was just a friend. He loved hanging out with me so he accepted being just a ""buddy"", tho i knew his feelings were deeper. We were together all the time for 2 yrs, then we had a bad argument and i wouldn't hang out with him anymore. Shortly after, we moved from there and i never saw him again. But everytime i ran into to ppl from the neighborhood, they would tell me how devastated he was. Even adults told me he must have been truly in love with me, even at such a young age. Now fast forward, all these decades later, I have started having recurring dreams about John. For several months now, at least 3 times a week, I dream that we run into each other and we are sooo happy to have found each other again. In the dreams, we are both willing to leave our current partners and do whatever it takes to be together. The real strange thing is...when I wake up, I am very sad and disappointed that it was just a dream! I wake up feeling like i have lost something very special in my life. Let me add that i am happily married to my partner of the last 10 yrs. I hate to sound cold, but at the time john and i parted ways all those yrs ago, it seemed insignificant to me. I had no romantic feelings for him then, so why in the world would i have them now? Or perhaps the dream isnt really about john, perhaps he represents something else? Any insight would be appreciated, and sorry it was so long.

I think the feelings associated with the Animus part are what we really want to give ourselves to feel completely whole. It's unconditional love and acceptance as we are, flaws and all. He probably symbolizes that because he had such a huge crush and wanted to be around you even though you didn't feel the same for him and because the relationship was during your formative years.",2022-05-02 00:00:00,,,,,,

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:48:46,1235685116953144,https://facebook.com/1235685116953144,100001037053553,Terry Dey,Elisah Meis I agree but we've noticed many of our dreamers arent always English proficient because its not their primary language so sometimes we have to work with it,2021-09-08 14:49:00

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

They are so frequent and I remember them all in very great detail. Sometimes I'm hiding in a bedroom pulling clothes out of drawers packing a bag. Sometimes I'm carrying my daughter trying to hide her from something and looking for weapons in the room to defend myself. Sometimes I give my daughter to someone else to protect her and I spend the rest of the dream looking for her. But I am always in a hurry and feeling scared and threatened. Always looking for an open window or a bag to pack up my things.

What part of you has died?

Where in your life are you beginning to become invisible?

What part of your life or personality is no one seeing anymore?

It seems it's still there, because it's a part of your spirit, an essential part of who you are yet it has been allowed to fall away. Perhaps you are no longer nurturing this side of youself?

He has been using and abusing A1cohol and other stuff that’s not legal. He is off the deep end I had him admitted to inpatient treatment. The first week when he was coming down he was saying all this stuff knowing it would hurt me to hurt me because he isn’t in right state of mind. So this psychic has read my whole relationship and the cards and our spirits showed within a x time frame his spirit will be cleansed enough to know the difference between what he is saying and stuff so to avoid other confrontation she told me to stop communication for the time being. So I can’t contact for Atleast 3 weeks but I’m afraid he is up to no good in there since it’s both male/ female but I’m not sure if this would cause the dream,2022-05-02 00:00:00

What I mean by this is, the dream loves you so much that it keeps providing you with the feedback on how to evolve. And in order to do that, it will tell you what is holding you back, needs to be changed etc..
Shoes is usually a pun on issues. The meaning of white can represent (self) criticism, living too cleanly. Laces would represent being tied/limited/
constricted/
reined in/by this issue.
Dream is inviting you to look at this aspect of your life and where it may apply and become actually more comfortable around certain things.
The thing is 'the white' is probably useful in one area of life but may hinder the other.
Hope this helps.",2022-05-01 14:49:13,,,,,,

I had a dream about twin biracial girls . They were absolutely beautiful around the ages of 10 years old. They had blue eyes and I can remember myself trying to see if I recognized their energy. While the girls talked to me, I noticed they were both extremely different. I can remember talking to them and one of the girls talked about how she was connected to her roots, and although she was biracial she didn't feel any connection to her European side.She identified herself as Black. The other twin explain that she was well connected to her European side and also said she wanted no parts of her African Ancestry Side. This twin identified herself as White . They were both sweet girls , but I reiterate they're completely different. This dream felt real, but I don't understand it.Im not European, however I have European relatives down the line.

I was at my work, and had walked to my car. I saw teenagers leaning against my car. One was sitting on my car window. I came closer, he had broken my window. He looked kike he didnt give a care. I grabbed him by his shirt, made him look at the damage, and I told him, "" you see what you did?! You! Are gonna pay for this damage!! Go get paper and a pen, and I want your parents number. DO YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID???"". I was so raged, I was having a hard time texting my manager. I know me shouting and angry in the dream means I'm blowing off steam from waking life. What does broken window would mean?",2022-05-02 10:43:58,0.000000,1,0,1412142169307437,https://facebook.com/1412142169307437,560345596,Alexandra Moulding,"Hi , i have a few suggestions for you. It could be to do with your behaviour in regards to how you move forward in life. That may or may not also have ties work and career.

Something about your teenage self is obscuring your outlook and your view is broken in some way. Think about how old the teens were in the dream and what was going on for you at that age. If it were my dream I would be looking for my own behaviours then and seeing what traits I still hold.

It may be the ""I don't care"" is an arrogance you hold, this could be a reactionary habit formed at that time in order to self protect.

I feel that the confrontation is about looking at yourself and confronting the issue. What has been broken within you and what is responsible for that damage? How have the events of your teenage years damaged your ability to move forward with clear sight.

I feel the need to contact the parents suggests that you would like your own parents or upbringing to take some responsability for the damage.

The manager is you and your own internal management system. It may be that you have a lot of repressed anger and rage carried forward from that time. The ""I don't care"" might be an attitude formed though not being able to change a situation. Sometimes if we have no agency we detratch or disassociate as it's the only option we have at the time that allows us to escape and avoid facing the emotions we have.

This is one possible interpretation.
Others might offer alternatives of course.",2022-05-02 00:00:00,,,,,,

Last night I had a dream I was in my car with my window half open. On my left side a little bit up the road I seen a tractor on the banks of the river. It was somehow spraying muddy water from the back, as if it was trying to get unbogged. I knew what was going to happen as I passed the tractor, so I took a deep breath and held it for a second as I got sprayed on the side of my face through my open window. Then I looked in the mirror and I got a little bit giggly because of the incident.

So she yelled for the driver to stop and ran off the bus. When she was off the bus she started puking to get it out. I feel like we left her there but can't remember much after that.

This friend has on occasion messaged me awkwardly only to ghost the conversation.. and one of those occasions she said she'd had a dream that her and I were sitting around a bonfire. We hadn't talked in years before that point.

Then I was standing at Lake Ontario. My parents were alive and there living together. My father was upset because my mother gives all siblings except me $1000 a month.
I was upset because my significant other stopped stooping me.
I read two books in one day.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:50:07,1235685116953144,https://facebook.com/1235685116953144,100001037053553,Terry Dey,Elisah Meis I agree but we've noticed many of our dreamers arent always English proficient because its not their primary language so sometimes we have to work with it,2021-09-08 14:50:20

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:50:07,1235686206953035,https://facebook.com/1235686206953035,100001027268137,Elisah Meis,Thats true... however a bit more info would be extremely helpful.,2021-09-08 14:50:21

I saw two boys dressed as Ghost Face. Minus the mask first. (Scream Movies.) as I walked by I heard one boy say he wanted to kill me. Then he put his mask on. His friend/brother said I wasn't worth it Then put his mask on. They disappeared. I kept walking and came across a rodeo. I was watching the rodeo. And one of the performers was wearing a tan and red poncho. He had crutches and was getting assistance from someone to the center of the ring. Next thing I saw was it was part of the act and he was fine. I was enjoying the rodeo. Just then a little boy walked up to me said he wanted me to buy him a toy. I walked into a store and saw two women in there. (I believe they were a couple) The one woman was thanking me for finding her son. She said he ran away cause he wanted to see the rodeo. And they wanted to go shopping first. The woman introduced herself as Jessica and the other was Darla. Just then the three of them were gone. I went back out. Next thing I was back outside and this young girl ran toward me. She was saying something about these two guys were after her. She was scared and shaking. She said they are trying to kidnap her. She asked me to help hide her. I took to this abandon building that was pitch black inside. She went in and I stayed outside to fight the two guys following her.,2022-05-01 23:47:42,0.000000,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I started having the dream, but then I would wake up, fall back to sleep, and the dream would continue. Not following on exactly, but more like it was a second, third, fourth and fifth episode.

The dream was about zombies. In the first episode it was children that were turning into zombies, and people were barricading themselves in their homes.

In the second episode, people were gathering together in community areas.

In the third episode, survivors were trying to get over a long bridge but were being picked off by someone with a gun.

In the fourth episode it was like the zombies were worker ants going to and from a massive house.

In the fifth episode, the survivors were in this big house trying to escape (there's no logic).

Then I woke up for good. I know I was awake for real as I got up to use the toilet or see to my son. I was falling asleep and dreaming straight away. Usually I'll have completely different dreams, not anything following on.

Anyone else had this before?",2022-05-01 20:07:55,0.000000,1,0,1411686132686374,https://facebook.com/1411686132686374,100001037053553,Terry Dey,I wont interpret as you asked me not to.

It was a home that a very wealthy family would have. Not a flashy like family but one that owns property and...well like Godfather meets YellowStone type of family. I was set to marry a man who was of much older age. I didn't want to. I kept running away and hiding. I would be found and brought back.
I was watched and unable to leave the house. One thing I kept doing was hiding away in this one room in the highest part of the house to just stair at this chandelier.
One part of the dream I am walking around in circle stair at this chandelier and I see my reflection of me. I am looking how I am not all skinny skinny but I have lost weight and I am satisfied with how my body looks. Slim but thick. And then I look at the chandelier. I go down to the kitchen and all the older women who my mom, grandmother are telling me to stop fussing about the wedding. But I know the man they are having me marry is an older and very fat man. Who I don't know at all.
So I run again up to the room and just watch the chandelier. I just want to watch the chandelier and when I close my eyes another man comes to mind but I don't fully see him. I feel him and it feels like the man that I have been in love with for the past few years in real life. But I don't see anyone...just feel them and I keep walking around in circles or sitting and gazing at the chandelier.",2022-05-01 15:13:21,,1,0,1411707519350902,https://facebook.com/1411707519350902,100001037053553,Terry Dey,"Jasmine Marie I would interpret this dream as two potential future scenarios you see internally. One is a future that seems dependable, expected (perhaps by family), and would seem from the outside like the path of wisdom. But internally you are focused on different path.

You are focused in the dream on following your own path....not the one you are expected in life to take.",2022-05-01 00:00:00,,,,,,

Makeup can mean wanting to put a good face on it, to feel better. Getting something to eat could mean you feel a hunger/desire that isn’t being satisfied. She’s representing that it seems strange and you don’t like it, you’re not comfortable. The house being caught on fire could mean you’re burning up about it, feeling angry. The grandmas bf could be representing some wise action to take, but since he’s asleep and can’t wake up, it represents you feel you don’t know what to do about it, what wise action to take.",2022-05-01 14:50:41,,,,,,

You saw someone who was a murderer in real life. I know I'm terrified of Humans because of how unbelievably brutal we can be. This shadow anchorage of mine says to me ""OMG he's human I'm human what drove him to this could I have the same SEED in me??"" and I shudder because it's a terrifying thought. I believe that's what played out in your dream.

Had it been a person you knew in real life, I believe the meaning would be very different (you'd have been slaying some patriarchal anchorages).

You seem to be symbolically slaying a FEAR anchorage that you have in an aspect of the Human psyche (our collective fear/death shadow).

When you put the Head in a bag filled with water, to me it means you're willing to ""integrate"" this shadow now, you're willing to let it immerse without remaining an anchorage you ""draw"" from and ""feed"" simultaneously,
ie you'll grow out of certain fears that connect to the most brutal aspects of the Human psyche.

This will happen as part of your spiritual ascension onto the next ""phase"" for your specific ascension path.",2022-05-01 14:50:44,,,,,,

I tried to secure the house but the black bear found a way in through a door I didn't know about.

Suddenly there was ice everywhere and we were all trapped on a set of metal stairs leading up to the flight deck. It was freezing and we couldn't move. I began to sob hysterically and dropped to the floor that was icy cold.

Started off with being near the beach with my OH and watching large boulders being dropped into the sea, which we thought were bombs.

Next thing I know, I'm on a ship, something similar to a cargo ship. Something bad happened and we all had to evacuate, but we (the other people on the boat, not my OH as he wasn't there) missed the last flight off.

Suddenly there was ice everywhere and we were all trapped on a set of metal stairs leading up to the flight deck. It was freezing and we couldn't move. I began to sob hysterically and dropped to the floor that was icy cold.
I wanted to die and get it over with, so much that I almost jumped from the railing but was stopped by a random guy.

The rest is blurry after that. I remember being comforted, but not sure by who.

Any thoughts?",2022-05-01 09:45:06,0.000000,1,0,1411300216058299,https://facebook.com/1411300216058299,560345596,Alexandra Moulding,"Hi, the dream suggests you ard trying to navigate some difficukt emotions.

There is a situation that you feel could be devastating and explosive but actually is less volatile than you imagine. Though It still causes major emotional disruption and obstacles in your life.

My thoughts are that you feel very vulnerable as you try to navigate the repercussions of this event, you would like to escape but you are unable.

I feel the ice represents frozen emotions. A feeling of being stuck and unable to find releif or release. You would like to move on or make changes but you are potentially afraid I feel. You perhaps are unable to let your true feeling be known. I wonder if this is related to yoyr relationship in some way.

Its not possible for the dream to navigate another persons potential thpughts or fedlings only jow you perceive them. In my method everyone represents an aspect of yourself so it suggests that you are afraid afraid in some way and wish there could be love between you.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?""). Share the whole dream.",2021-08-14 06:44:34,76.000000,25,0,1257931454728510,https://facebook.com/1257931454728510,100001464528257,Laikara Reed,Thanks Timothy💜,2021-10-08 14:51:28,,,,,,

Find out a bit about her younger days for specific traumas. If there aren't any major traumas you can identify then she could be representing ""Anchorages"" into old Feminine psyche, old Feminine values, old Feminine energies that you're growing out of as a natural part of life.

Either way, the shadows we shed Light on and grow out of, feel we're attacking and murdering them so they ""attack"" us and scare us but they can't actually do anything besides creating fear which they then latch on to and survive through.

Losing someone close is also a traumatic experience. It affects how we perceive our loved ones in our dreams.. Perhaps, some of the fear and her latching on connects to your pain of ""losing"" her as well. Just some thoughts for when you work on this.

I'm sorry I forgot to add.. It is indeed my own experience and hence belief that mirrors are portals. But to be used as a very effective tool.

To me, what she said means the shadow connected to your grandmother that resides in your body through a blood bond, saw itself in the mirror, got exposed, and that's how it surfaced in your conscious mind..

I believe talking to oneself in the mirror is an excellent exercise in ""taming"" the Ego, the conscious mind. Your fear is the shadows not wanting to face themselves because when they do, they then have to show themselves just as the dream you saw..

Strong spiritual boundaries help with how the shadows come through. The stronger the boundaries, the less intimidating their visit and the easier or less symptomatic their ""integration"".

When she says she won't let you turn the light on, that's shadow-speak for ""I won't let you kill me"" as ""shadow-work"" is about shedding Divine Light on trauma shadows to ""heal"" them. Traumas hide in the shadows, they are the shadows..

Find out a bit about her younger days for specific traumas. If there aren't any major traumas you can identify then she could be representing ""Anchorages"" into old Feminine psyche, old Feminine values, old Feminine energies that you're growing out of as a natural part of life.

Either way, the shadows we shed Light on and grow out of, feel we're attacking and murdering them so they ""attack"" us and scare us but they can't actually do anything besides creating fear which they then latch on to and survive through. They're just shadows, they work through perception, illusion, ""Magic"".

My suggestion would be energy cleansing using Earthing/
Grounding and increasing water intake (I always suggest these two for a smoother ascension as we're all experiencing ascension symptoms globally).

I'd highly recommend the scents of rose, jasmine, and sandalwood around you.

Send healing and love to the vision you saw. She told you she was your grandmother so you'd know the thread that connects her to you, so you'd know whom to send Love and Light to.

Focus on strengthening your Heart Chakra. All Chakras spin and as they spin they ""cleanse"". Cleansing is transmuting because energy doesn't go anywhere it transmutes into other forms of energy.

When we divert focus to the Chakras during meditation, they are energized. Energized Chakras cleanse better even on autopilot ie when you're not meditating.

Cleansed Chakras mean stronger spiritual boundaries which means greater ""protection"".",2022-05-01 14:51:32,1410871442767843,https://facebook.com/1410871442767843,100004842668541,Caterina Paramour,"Sarah B Gillani I need you as part of my healing journey !!

We are close to a new moon and solar eclipse. The energies are the moment are insane!

I had these types of lucid attacks during the last full moon. It seems to be happening to people a lot more frequently. They're also using people we know, love or like in our dreams and using them in negative ways.

I've learnt the difference between a dream that is my subconscious speaking to me and trying to pull out left over trauma and when it's a message from somewhere else.

The messages from elsewhere can get hijacked. If you're into using crystals put some black obsidian or black tourmaline next to your bed. Also if you listen to music watch the frequency, most isn't recorded at 432hertz. It was all changed back in the 1940s so frequency can change your mood and where you end up when sleeping. 😊",2022-05-01 14:51:36,1410425596145761,https://facebook.com/1410425596145761,600856549,Shanna Baer,"I will try to be more aware, the other false awakenings it was just me, until the last one when I ""got all the way up"" and tried to turn on the lamp, I noticed her as I was walking to the lamp.",2022-05-01 14:51:49

When I sleep before bed, I smoke weed. Regardless of what I do before bed, the weed keeps me from dreaming, with the exception of waking up at some point and going back to sleep, which leads to extremely vivid lucid dreaming/
astral projection. Similarly, this was a nap, and when I take a nap before work, I don't smoke beforehand so I *always* have vivid lucid dreams/AP. Sometimes I take naps solely because of this with the intention of connecting spiritually. This wasn't that, though, I literally just dozed off on my couch and that sometimes leads to ""waking up"" in the same room, with some differences, sometimes several times. There is almost never another person and I freak out when there is.

Things they all have in common:

1. It's always night time. I have windows in my house that let in lots of sun, but it's always night, even if it's light outside in waking life. This is actually true of all my dreams, not just the ones like this.

2. The lights are off in the house but I can still see. The light and lamp switches not working is what makes me become lucid if something else hasn't already done so.

3. I am usually alone, because i live alone, and if it's a nap before work, when I ""wake up"", I go about what I would normally do when I woke up from a nap, like get ready for work, makeup, etc. until something triggers me to realize I'm dreaming. A few times, I was a half hour into my work night before it came to me. I work at night so sometimes it took me longer to question my surroundings. I was pretty annoyed every time I had to do it all over again.

4. Everything is exactly the same until it isn't. During false awakenings, I wake up exactly where I am, over and over and it feels so real. I have a theory on this and dimension/
timeline alterations, especially because...

..5. These are way harder to wake up from than any other type of dream. With other dreams, I wake up fully right away and start to forget small details little by little. With these dreams, I have to actively fight HARD to get my eyelids to open because if they're closed I will slip back in, but it's like a magnet is pulling them shut and and I'm fighting against it. It makes me start to panic because I can't wake myself up. I mean, it's hard as hell, and I lose over and over until I finally win and I'm so tired the rest of the day I also don't forget them the same way. I remember all of my dreams to a degree, but these are vivid like memories. I'm in the same room now and its making me uncomfortable thinking about it.

This is what the false awakening/AP dreams have in common, I have other experiences, like night terrors, and not being able to talk/yell/
scream which makes me cry and I actually am crying/hoarse when I wake up, hearing a word shouted at me as I wake up, someone yelling my name, etc. but idk if they're related to this. I once had something yell ""wake up"" and snap me out of my sleep. I left the room and insisted my dog come with me just due to a feeling and less than 3 minutes later, my entire bedroom ceiling fell in right where I was sleeping. I'm no stranger to odd sleep occurances and spiritual experiences, but this dream stood out to me simply because there were other people present and the things they said. I'm not used to anyone else being there in these types of dreams specifically, so it's messing with me. I will try your suggestions, and thank you so much for responding!",2022-05-01 14:51:50

Becuz I also use it to turn off my brain. I relate to everything you are saying. I definitely had experiences like this before.

You could also try to see a native healer. But I think this could also be partly a night terror for you as well and acts on your reflexes a lot. Otherwise you would be waking up with scratches on your body or your environment is disrupted like a dent in the wall or pillows thrown across the room. That's what usually happens during a ghost spiritual attack. Most ghosts or spirits will attack physically instead of just scaring you. This can also happen with someone who has active Rapid Eye movements during sleep, and is also a heavy sleeper. I think sometimes your own fears might turn the storyline in your dream state as well. That's just the other stuff I'm getting. That is mostly some kind of night terror with Rapid Eye movements and heavy sleep. Which can make you feel paralyzed in sleep or sometimes makes you feel trapped in your own body. It's just something to consider.

Also, if the same dream keeps repeating then it could be something that you need to deal with or havent dealt with properly. And for hearing screams, do you normally have sensitivity to sounds? Like if a horn was blown, it feels like someone stabbing a knife on your ear? It could also you picking up distance sounds whole you sleep and your brain utilizes the sounds. Or you might have a squeaky house too. But it could also mean that your brain is acting on a fear as well, and everything is combined into one dream salad.

Lastly, if it is more spiritual then washing your hair in sage will benefit you alot. The cedar will calm you and bitter root you can put in a tea and will clean your system on the inside. Those combined should help you so that you can have some control of your dreams. You would have to make a routine to maintain it. Or having those items on stock so that you can use them when you need them.",2022-05-01 14:51:51

I'm not generally sensitive to sounds when I'm asleep, I sleep through 6-10 alarms, tornado sirens, phone calls, people knocking on my door, etc. Lol I'm OUT. Those screams and voices came from inside my head, distinctly, but I'm not schizophrenic I swear lol. It's hard to explain, but it was similar to my internal monologue, just loud AF, and in a different voice, but not a voice i recognize.

There's only one time I've ever had a scratch I couldn't explain. I have cats so I always say it had to be them, but this particular scratch was almost a foot long, down the side of my thigh. And I had been sleeping on that side all night, so there's no way the cat could have scratched me. I looked in the bed for something that could have done it, but I didn't find anything. That was roughly 3 weeks ago. Aside from that, I've never had any marks on my physical body when I woke up, and like I said, usually I'm alone in these dreams, it was really odd that someone was even there. I'm not usually attacked like that, I just go through a period of false awakenings by myself, 3 or 4 times until I wake up for real. Thats partly why I don't always realize right away that I'm dreaming, because everything is almost exactly the same as it would be if I were awake, just without lights. Lol",2022-05-01 14:51:51

I didn't feel good about it and tried to talk to them about it. But then there was an Indian couple that were my cousins parents (which that's not her parents in real life)
And her parents were yelling at me and calling me homophobic for objecting against the marriage between my sister and my cousin, but I explained that's not true. I'm bisexual and support lgtbq+, that's not the problem.
I was more worried about my sisters reckless spending. In buying a gold/diamond ring when she hardly has any money to survive and is in between homes. Even tho they are related so...

enjoyment.

Firstly, there are guided meditations/
lucid dreaming tutorials on YouTube. That might help prompt better dreams, or at least give you some control over the bad ones. With time and effort you can probably teach yourself to recognize when you are dreaming, and possibly even wake yourself up. A lot of people have at least moderate success with that.

Daydreaming about something really interesting and positive before sleep can help.

THIS is weird ass tip, but it works for me as a memory trick, and for dreams too, so I’ll put it out there on the chance that it helps. I hold onto one of my earrings while thinking intently about what I want to remember or dream about, picture putting that thought into the earring, and imagine that it goes into your ear/brain as you sleep. It’s bizarre, but worth a shot.

If you haven’t tried it already, pillow sprays and aroma therapy can be really soothing.

Some other things to consider would be certain foods or drinks before bed. chocolate, melatonin, caffeine, spicy or fermented foods can all cause hellish nightmares. Being too hot or cold in the night can trigger some nasty dreams too. Milk, cherries, and turkey can all help aid in getting to sleep, but I don’t know how or if they affect dreams.

Music or relaxing sounds might help, and working out or stretching a few hours before bed can also help sometimes.
I’ve also heard of a lot of folks keeping dream journals. It can help process thoughts so they don’t keep coming back up in your sleep.

Sorry for the long ass reply, hopefully some of those ideas help.. I know chronic nightmares are emotionally draining and upsetting to deal with, I hope you’re able to get some peace and good rest",2022-05-01 14:52:28

This happens if we have a bunch of unresolved issues or trauma that bogs us down, and we find ourselves defensive or triggered often by daily occurences, we cannot respond to these with openness or full responsiveness,
because we have shut ourselves down due to the fight, flight or freeze reaction. (I more and more think that the key to unconscious/
consciousness exploration is linked with parasympathetic
nervous system response. And that neuroscience is finding out what religion has said for a long time - that love is consciousness, the higher path, awareness.... it is only when we feel the safety of being loved that we can actually open our awareness with our higher faculties...)

And so many are stuck in this trap. Or puzzle or maze like an escape room. It is like a trap, because interestingly, we cannot truly figure out this unconscious reactivity this defensive triggered survival mode while we are actually in it. Neuroscience is saying this too. That you feel safe again first. THEN look at understanding the trigger.

But first, get out of the hole you are in, to see from a wider perspective.

Often, we get trapped in the survivalist mode because we try to figure it out from within that survivalist mode. For example, someone who feels triggered by another's behaviour might then identify that behaviour as the cause of the trigger. But this doesn't actually go very far in understanding, overcoming, or resolution. It merely cements the knowledge that the world is unsafe and that we have to have our defenses up instead of trying to find common ground.

The tunnels I think are a metaphor similar to the ""trances"" they often talk about in the new age (and sometimes psychology). The auto pilot mode, that is living unconsciously, without conscious awareness and choice making.

""Tunnel vision"" is seeing only the narrowest path in front of you and no way out. This can be like depression ""a long dark tunnel"". Tunneling into something also in a more positive way can be about obsessive focus on figuring out the originating path of some particular behavioural pattern. Sometimes I think we do have to delve deeply into an obsessive thought on a specific topic in order to understand that pattern in our life. But, as in your dream, the idea is to recall you are not just in a negative obsessive circular thought pattern. But that instead you are ""tunneling"" up and out, in order to find the secret way to unlock this particular unconscious behavioural pattern, to crack the code, to be able to stop unconsciously repeating it.

And how you are there with many other people trapped in this underground, and one is former dance partner...

Dance here can also be synonymous with that ""trance"" metaphor. Here, the struggle to find meaning of the unconscious while staying submerged in the unconscious.

""I was never good at that dance anyway, I gave it up when I had a family""

The defensive survivalist mode was never appealing for you to be stuck in, and having a family moved you further out of that.

Which makes sense to me. To consciously choose to have a family, it requires a huuuuuggggee amount of hope and faith and optimism. AND a longer view. AND a broader understanding of the self, knowing that the lower self for example immediate needs is not the whole self, which allows one to have more patience and delayed gratification, more giving. Because you can think of not just the immediate self, but also the past and future selves, a very expansive view of self that takes us out of immediate reactivity and makes us look at a wider overview.

Also though, the larger view of self and how that links with starting a family is the selfless love of having a family. That our wellbeing is now so palpably connected to ensuring the wellbeing of our family. It is a reminder we are not just alone, selfishness is very very narrow of a view. People are quite interconnected,
whether we can see that overview or not.",2022-05-01 14:52:32,,,,,,

Pink is often a sign of love. And the unnamed god is ""openhanded""

Agape love, universal love, what is termed also ""christian charity"", selfless love, a larger view of self, caring for others, ""gods love""...

As I said above, I think neuroscience (for example Stephen Porges polyvagal theory) is just telling us now what ancient religion and philosophy has also said. Agape love is the answer to consciousness. Giving it and receiving it opens the pathways.

Pathways here also are figurative, as in changing behavioural patterns in life through increasing overview and wider awareness. But also literal - opening and strengthening new pathways in the brain to form connections that used to be dead ends or circular thought patterns before.

Agape love, which I think is necessary in consciously starting a family, is linked with hope, faith, optimism, and it is definitely the guiding philosophical principle which can improve life for oneself and others 💙",2022-05-01 14:52:32,,,,,,

It reminds me very much of Discord where there was so many different levels and areas that people could explore, learn and work their way through. If they could, I got lost in it 😂. The ballroom dancing lessons are interesting because it doesn’t go with the rest of the dream. Therefore I linked it up with another room within the escape room structure. This room is filled with a ball or balls, another room and maybe the main room in your dream to challenge you. This could be you wanting to face some goals to allow you to become more connected with yourself.
To dance with someone you need to be in tune with them, so this could be looking at the connection you have with yourself. The connection is also needed in working out and understanding each room, each of different levels of thinking, to move you forward to where you want to be or do.
The temple is the focus of the dream, so to me this is showing where your energy and excitement is at the foremost part of your thinking. This is an old temple though and this makes me think you are using your experiences along previous passage ways to allow you to visit a new challenge which you haven’t invested any energy before.

Your mind may have been trying to tell you that you need to cut him out of your life, or let it go. The reason he may have changed to a different person in the end could be that you don't really want to hurt your brother at all, just the part of him that is doing bad and irresponsible things. That person could represent someone who has influenced or encouraged his negative behaviors in the past.

I wasn’t myself in this dream, I was a small, translucent, slime ball lol. I was super bouncy and could just bounce all over the place

The scene of the dream was like a video game level, I was contained in a giant cube-like area, and it was full of beautiful bright colors like purple, magenta, teal, and white. Super happy looking. There were tall platforms for me to jump onto and certain areas had little trampolines which would make me jump even higher.

In this it was exactly like a video game, I was trying to hop away from the enemy chasing me, I was having so much fun even though I was a bit scared to get caught! In order to stay ahead, I had to try to jump on the trampolines only so I could jump faster and higher each time. At one point I accidentally landed on flat tile (looked like bathroom tile, it was shiny and cold and I still remember how it felt landing on it) and I sort of just splatted on it and didn’t bounce. I had to shimmy my way back to the trampolines to bounce again, I was super close to getting caught by the enemy, but still got away!

I have no idea what this dream could mean 😂 it was sure fun",2022-04-30 18:08:46,0.000000,1,0,1410708919450762,https://facebook.com/1410708919450762,1234773332,Dee Ireland,"Hi Sarah, what a wonderful dream.

I was already inside the building and the guards weren’t letting me out. They told me to speak to someone inside. It was like grand central station. I saw the daughter of my old neighbor and she was tall. When I recognized her, I gave her a big hug and asked what she was doing there and she said her sisters were lying on her. Then I started pulling out keys and wallets that didn’t belong to me out of my pockets. My neighbor’s daughter had set me up. I’m trying to explain to everyone that I am not crazy. Then I woke up in a room with a bunch of other women lying on mattresses on the floor. I was barefoot and my phone was broken. But the only thing I thought of was my boyfriend and how he would never believe what happened to me. He would believe I was cheating on him. I called him and I’m crying on my broken phone, walking barefoot and 1/2 naked.

I'm grateful for the opportunity 🙂🙏💛💛💛

I have read it as a very beautiful and deeply spiritual dream narrating to me a story of a girl on a journey of Love and Madness. This Mad Love is the Self (Soul, Christ Consciousness) coming through. This Madness carries with it the trauma of all Madmen who have ever spilled pearls before swine and then faced the consequences of doing that. Within our minds we all carry a very deep rooted fear of ""exposure"".

This fear is a shadow blocking our inner Light.

Carl Jung never believed madness was madness. Christ Consciousness is Mad Divine Love channeling through a Human body. That's it.

When people's inner rejected shadows face the Light that bursts through you, they assume you to be a liar. Then they treat you like one. The fear is legitimate, but it's not an impasse.

You're showing to yourself in the dream how when you are ""unaware"", you subconsciously err on the side of courage, with an innocence and faith - you just found yourself in a line, walking to an asylum you're being guided to by an invisible hand. Faith and submission subconsciously.

And you ended up there, even as you think about escaping and delve in self-doubt.

It shows that on a subconscious level you're aligned well enough to take on your further phases up this ladder. This could be because of your spiritual practices in waking life.

Being in a line to the asylum means you've joined a certain vibrational frequency that some people are vibing at with you. You're never alone. This indicates the degree to which Christ Consciousness has invaded though you (and the world!). You recognize and appreciate that degree on a subconscious level.

The familiar girl you meet who sets you up, is an aspect of your Feminine psyche (probably ""virgin"" Feminine instincts of intuition, insight, acceptance etc) that you will rely on though this.

The keys and wallet you discover are the dimensions and assets you will discover emerging though you when you rely on these Feminine energies.

The boyfriend you miss (and how you miss him) demonstrates your current inner Masculine energies and how they're working with the inner Feminine. The Masculine Energies you carry are influenced by all the men who have ever influenced your life.

You're barefoot and half naked. Spiritual Ascension means you shed a lot of the Physical, the Maya, the Illusion that feeds your shadows. In most people, a ""minimalist"" lifestyle simply grows on them without them often even realizing. Broken phone means old modes of communication may not work as effectively. His response indicates you watch tik tok? 🙂

Social Media is always a tool that works for you or a weapon that works against you. What you choose to feed your conscious mind using this tool will determine how turbulent or smooth your ascension journey will be, as words cast spells whether read or spoken.

Barefoot is a pivotal symbol in dreams.

The Path to the Beloved is not paved with Roses alone but also Thorns. When the longing is Maddening enough, we walk barefoot, dazed, in a trance, to an ""asylum"" - a safe space to be mad in.

You're protected by forces beyond your knowledge and awareness. This access is there because you are consciously engaging in activities that are helping with your shadow-work.

Shadow-work is the workout that leads to ascension on the spiritual ladder. This entire journey is the journey of every single person - the journey of a Human to a Human Being - The Complete Human - Christ.",2022-05-01 14:53:00

I had a dream I was following a line that lead to an asylum. When I realized what the line lead to I tried to get off the line but it was too late. I was already inside the building and the guards weren’t letting me out. They told me to speak to someone inside. It was like grand central station. I saw the daughter of my old neighbor and she was tall. When I recognized her, I gave her a big hug and asked what she was doing there and she said her sisters were lying on her. Then I started pulling out keys and wallets that didn’t belong to me out of my pockets. My neighbor’s daughter had set me up. I’m trying to explain to everyone that I am not crazy. Then I woke up in a room with a bunch of other women lying on mattresses on the floor. I was barefoot and my phone was broken. But the only thing I thought of was my boyfriend and how he would never believe what happened to me. He would believe I was cheating on him. I called him and I’m crying on my broken phone, walking barefoot and 1/2 naked. I tell him what happened and asked him to come pick me up and he said “I can’t, I’m watching tik toks” 🤔🤔🤔🤔 and that’s all I remember. 🤦🏻‍♀️. Is there a deep meaning to this dream?

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

This one woke me up crying.
I walk into my house, to numerous cat poops on the floor, but they are all on fire. (Orange flames) But instead of putting out the fire, I walk past. I realize that there are also cat toys on fire too. There are two kittens, but it seems that everything they touch is becoming enflamed. One of the cats bats a toy my way and suddenly it’s on fire. One of the cats is playing under a coffee table and the toy/carpet is on fire so much it singes her fur! I grab the cat and cry because she’s singed but it doesn’t seem hurt then. I tell the other person the cats are setting things on fire, as they seem unaware. They snap back at me and then me: “it’s YOUR cat setting everything on fire!!!”
I quickly realize that somehow they set a couch on fire, mainly the arm of the couch. The foam inside is smoldering. I run to get a bucket, but the first one is broken. The next one is full of dirty water, so I try and flush it down the toilet but it goes everywhere and the bucket proceeds to break too. I run to the kitchen to get a large cup just to slow the smoldering. But the water pressure is low and it’s taking forever. I fill the cup as much as I can and run to extinguish the fire. I keep going back for more water, and eventually find that the foam is smoldering near the floor, so I focus my attention there. Soon the foam reaches the floor/carpet and starts to set it on fire too. Now I’m aiming at the floor, as the smoldering has turned to actual fire. The floor becomes completely engulfed in flames and I can’t do anything except watch the flames crawl across the floor and up the wall. *wake up crying*",2022-04-30 14:50:47,,1,0,1410626556125665,https://facebook.com/1410626556125665,1234773332,Dee Ireland,"Hi Tracey, I am wondering if emotionally you are feeling out of control. You could be feeling detached from something or even yourself. At the start of the dream you don’t seem to be in control but then later on in your dream you seem to wake up and take action but this then shows you could be feeling overwhelmed about something. You could also be feeling consumed by something, this could be with sadness which could result in a lack of motivation which was shown at the beginning. Your dream does seem to show you trying to heal and I think you need to give yourself time to be able to do this. At the start your cats are playing and want you to play with them, this could be showing the need to be able to let go of things and to focus on doing things where you can have fun instead of worrying about what others think.",2022-05-01 14:53:26,,,,,,

I was in a different country, though I don’t know which ones. From the outside, it seemed tiny, dainty. Inside it was beautiful. Each floor was very small, painted lavender, and there were maybe about seven stories. Like my own personal tower. The rooms were full of furniture from the previous owner.

It started off amazing. Me, my mother (my mother lives in another country) and my best friend and her husband were cleaning the place out. I was keeping the furniture I did want, giving away others. One the rooms was a children’s room, with a small bed and a crib, both made of golden coloured metal. I gave the crib to my friend, as in my dream she was either newly pregnant or trying for a baby. As we were emptying that room, someone got a call that a local boy had been kicked out of his house by his awful father. We all knew of him. I told her to tell the kid he could stay here, in this room until he could go home or figure something out.

The boy never showed up in the dream, but somewhere around that conversation is when things started to go wrong.

My friend took a shower and saw someone looking at her from the drain. We checked every drain, and every drain in the house had someone looking through it. Like all you could see was the eyeball, looking up. The floorboards were suddenly rotten, they looked fine, but I’d step on them and they’d start to collapse down. I fell through the floor and into the basement of the house.

I contacted an insurance agent, and when I explained the issues he started to laugh, hysterically. Then that scene disappeared and suddenly I was someone else, a teen girl, trying desperately to pretend I went to a school I know I didn’t, trying to get this group of people to let me go somewhere with them. And not in the way of a teen just wanting to be included, they were doing something dangerous or bad and this girl, for some reason, needed to gain their trust, have them underestimate her, so she could find out what it was. It felt like her life depended on it. They ended up letting her tag along, but I woke up as soon as they started to walk away with her.

I don’t dream too often, and when I do they’re always so strange and I can never make sense of them, but this one left me a little freaked out.",2022-04-30 04:10:07,0.000000,1,0,1410494179472236,https://facebook.com/1410494179472236,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"The house represents you I think, and doing a self spring clean, going through changes.

The seven stories are particularly interesting if you know anything about the chakras...

I think the rejected boy being adopted represents integrating your own rejected masculine traits but in so doing creates personal chaos as the person you wete comfortable as starts to fall apart and deteriorate. I read it as you becoming uncomfortable as you go through these changes, perhaps feel you were not quite as great as you previously considered perhaps.

I think thats why you become a teemage girl, a period of time of self discovery, going through a new ""coming of age"" process.",2022-05-01 14:53:33,,,,,,

1. My father got horrible rashes (scallops sized 4-5 acne on his face) and sick and not able to participate and enjoy during family festivities. I am somehow away from him and miss him and couple days later he posts on FB his rashes healed but he lost unhealthy amount of weight and wearing ugly clothes.

2. Trapped in driving my car when for some reason I can’t open my eyes and see anything and really hoping not to hit anything. Really trying hard to be able to open my eyes and putting lots of effort and finally able to open for few seconds before it closed off again. And those few seconds saw some cop cars in front of me not behind. Somehow I know I am on a narrow freeway and put lots of effort to be able to pull over. Then panicking what if I have hit a person and then they might have been hurt or died and I don’t know about it.

3. I am in home of some actress I don’t care about and they are leading a normal life. I am just there and it doesn’t make sense but they are not bothering me or interacting with me but I am somewhat comfy and exploring. Later someone in their home want to take their dogs on a walk 5-6 aggressive dogs and the dogs are on a leash but the person take a pair of scissors and cut off the leash.

In my dream my sister started smoking again. Each smoke she took out had a green filter tip. Some were dark green and some were light.
She then gave me a smoke to hold while she was doing something. I handed it back to her and she had a surprised look on her face and said, u didnt smoke it. I said no i dont want it.

I had a dream that I needed support on a project. Instead of ordering the customized necklaces with my husband and I photo, my brother in law wife order a real small pin. She put the pin on my t-shirt but it fell off because it was so tiny. Then I remember seeing this woman submit in verification of her marriage with photos to get inside the group for married people but in reality I’m inside this group as well for married people. I asked for her support and she got a small sized pin and started drawing on it instead of purchasing it. It was extremely small as well. I walked into the house and my husband grabbed me by the waist. He told me that I don’t need any friends.

I won’t describe the first 3 but it all ends with the world ending. The last dream that I had was the same thing but details are that I was at Walmart and they offered us to bunker down in their warehouse. It started with us being informed about the world ending. Everyone was panicking and buying everything. I told my husband that we may have better luck at the Walmart in Mexico (we live in Florida but I have family in Brownsville Texas.) so we crossed the border into Walmart and bought what we needed. Then I realized I forgot water for my kids. I have 2 type one diabetic kids so they need it. By the time we got back my kids where separated and I was worried about their insulin. I was stuck in the car with my husband because we got back after the time that the news announced of the world ending.

Backstory I don’t know if this could be related to the dream so my son (toddler) has and random scratches on him could be from himself through the night we recently changed diapers due to saving money and we noticed during the day he would scratch his back area where the diaper was. he sometimes has scratches on his head or other places. We have changed back diapers now to see if the diaper was the problem he also has a form of eczema so he has itchy skin at times . I told my husband it freaks me out cause my mom brain over thinks and since he wakes up with them in the morning I think what if a ghost or something. My husband reassures me there is no ghost .

Anyways last night I had a dream and The dream was
I wake up and go to my son to get him out of his crib and he has scratches all over his tummy and back and I freak out send a video to my hubby .I go sit on the bed with him and I remember just being so scared in the room. We wind up at some hotel and it’s me and my sisters and hubby and we all just hanging out and I ask him if he has watched the video he hasn’t that he left his phone and I tell him about it and he doest take it serious so I try to leave and I’m in the parking lot and my car is next to another vehicle and it has a walker in between it I assume it was my great grandma because she used a walker ( she has recently passed )
I open the door slightly and turn the key and then go to passenger side to get in when I noticed my fiancé turn off the car and say your not leaving . Some more stuff happened the scene changed I was at my grandma house in the backyard and the fish was jumping out the water . I often dream about the pond of my grandparents backyard but I don’t think it has to much meaning in this dream . ￼

Honestly it could be me just overthinking so much that I’m having dreams about it but I hope he’s okay and if anyone can let me know if their is a meaning to this dream that would be great.",2022-04-28 20:01:53,0.000000,1,0,1409473779574276,https://facebook.com/1409473779574276,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"In my opinion all dreams have meaning, but being a symbolic message they can be really odd.

My suspicion is that the dream characters are symbols of aspects of yourself and not about those people external to you in waking.

In that context I'd see your child as either an inner child aspect or maybe, and I think given the scene with the car as a symbol of the personal journey this is how I would lean, that he is a symbol of your personal development (the new version if you that has come out of you).

Your partner I think is representing your intellect (masculine as thinking vs feminine as feeling). So I would see this as saying your innrr child or developing self has been attacked but you don't understand how or why, and are intellectually refusing to contemplate it.

And in that refusal you are as a result also refusing to continue your journey (not driving).

I think the walker might be tied to that too, like you have the option to engage your analytucal mind and figure what is causing this issue and resolve the problem at its root, or you can stop your personal growth journey, put up with the symptoms (walker as a support dealing with being in a disabled state).

Thats not the only way to look at these symbols though, just how I see the dream patterns.",2022-05-01 14:54:12,,,,,,

Horns can certainly have links to evil, but it can link to nature; and in combination something you view as evil could be in her nature due to her own past experiences.

But then the mother figure could be representative of the divine feminine which you could argue has been demonised.

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:54:26,1235685116953144,https://facebook.com/1235685116953144,100001037053553,Terry Dey,Elisah Meis I agree but we've noticed many of our dreamers arent always English proficient because its not their primary language so sometimes we have to work with it,2021-09-08 14:54:41

Rather than fighting it, work towards the integration of this image as it is part of you. You can draw it out or simply observe the image of a tigress (you said it was her)
Tigers are often found in the dreams commenting on the career as well.

To me, to stand up to the tiger, you needed to face a fear but at the same time, you had to remain calm in order to protect your dog and cats. Therefore the part of you which represents your cats and dogs could be where you feel safe and secure, but the tiger is where you lack trust and understanding. Confronting the tiger, means you could be facing up this and controlling your fear of facing up to things.",2022-04-24 14:54:44,,,,,,

Also babies are emotional creatures and moms have tons of emotions tied to their infants. Being trapped in the water can signify baby at the mercy of infant emotions as well as her feeling trapped in her maternal emotions. The paddle board could be representing feelings about staying above her emotions as well as linking to her own feelings about her probable restrictions in freedom as mother of a 9 month old.,2022-05-01 14:55:10,,,,,,

All the people in the dream represents a part of you, so there is a part that is a bit aggressive, perhaps gets confrontational

Last night I dreamt a typical, nondescript dream, but then my dream was interrupted. It quite literally felt like someone had hacked my brain with an extremely realistic and vivid video that was being broadcast; it almost felt like a subliminal message being flashed quickly. It was a dark forest at night as I faced a line of trees, presumably the edge of a forest. A metal sign hung from the middle tree in front of me that had the feeling of a No Tresspassing sign. Besides the illegible text at the top, there was an all-seeing eye right in the middle. Suddenly red and blue lights flashed behind it alternatively, like cop car lights, VIVIDLY and almost neon and overly saturated. Fog started rolling out behind the sign from the lights, and the “video” started zooming in slowly towards the sign while rotating. The focus was always on the sign. After that, I returned to my nondescript dream that I was in prior to that.

It very much felt like someone had hacked my dream to show me this scene, like an urgent message. It didn’t feel like I personally was there, rather that someone had filmed it objectively with the intention of sending it to me.

l somewhat understand the significance of the forest and the eye, but what I can’t wrap my head around, is the feeling that someone or something intervened in my dream to show me this bizarre image.

Or is it the dark sinister symbol of a shadowy organisation seeking to manipulate in a negative way? Are the emergency red and blue lights the symbol of the cops and an emergency that something is wrong or is it the lights of a healing ambulance?

I can only really ask because I don't know, it coukd be framed against the other activities in the dream possibly.

It was such a short burst of an image but I'll do my best to at least tell you what it felt like!

It felt like the line of trees going into the forest acted like a gate. I feel like I was supposed to be going inside, but that the metal plate with the eye on it was describing what was beyond. I feel like the lights flashing and mist were separate from the sign identifying what was beyond the trees. I think I was meant to go into the forest, like something was waiting for me beyond the sign that I needed to see or do. And the lights gave me this sense of ""if you go in here things won't be the same, are you SURE you want to proceed?""

The lights felt disembodied, I don't think they were attached to anything like a cop car or ambulance, more like sentient lights.

One more thing I remember is towards the end, when the vision was zooming in towards the eye, the color of the lights started blending together and turning purple behind the eye.

I hope that helps 🙏",2022-05-01 14:55:23

I had a dream this week that I was getting married to someone I didn’t know.
I could see guests arriving but they were all dressed in very casual clothing, where I was getting ready to put on my wedding dress which I never got to see, I woke up before the actual wedding.
Whilst getting ready I was very disappointed that a close friend hadn’t turned up for the wedding and was then hoping that my unknown groom wasn’t going to show.
I remember reading cards from guests congratulating me on getting married, it was only my name on the card.

Hello I have been having a lot of dreams about college. I never went to a university or dorm of any sort.

Dream: packing up my dorm room trying to make sure I have all of my stuff because Once leave I can’t go back. In previous dreams I can never get everything packed to fit in my bags and take with me. last night I had family helping. my (divorced sense I was age 1) mom and dad helped. My dad drove out to wherever I was to put big things that wouldn’t fit on plane In his tiny car. My mom flew out to help. once we were ready to get on plane to head home my kids and cat showed up. I watched as they all buckled up and got ready for take off. But I was outside the window/door watching. I ended up missing the flight as it took off I was panicked. Not for me for my mom because she would be worried about me left alone in an unfamiliar place so late at night￼. I told her I’m ok I’ll catch the next one that was coming at 3 am. No biggie. ITS Ok! IM OK! is what I was yelling to her as the plane took off. The people in the airport looked worried for me till i said no I’m good I’m worried about her worrying. Then all the sudden I’m back in dorm room packing with my dad. He had helped take all the pictures of loved ones and special things down off the walls. We had almost everything packed up he was fitting my king size bed in his tiny car along with other large objects. I was just going to ride home with him I though why wait for the next plane. He said he was going to come back Monday and buy a pice of furniture I was leaving behind and even though I wanted the piece still I was like ok my loss his gain. He’s helping that’s what’s right I’ll find a new one. Then all the sudden he was gone and one of my kids was with me. we were packing anything else we could find before the next plane came. Odd thing here was we were packing purses and other to go bags into our bag to bring. Once I was on the plane my kid turned into one of my dogs and our other dog was outside the plane barking and now it was snowing. I looked out the window saw her and told the people not to take off. They opened the planes long back hatch like on a military plane to let her in and she came running up. I could feel the coldness coming from her. then i watched the snow melting once she sat next to me and I could feel the warmth of her snuggle. Then we were ready to take off but I told them I had to pee before the plane took off. The flight attendant was not happy bc I did the same thing last time before the plane almost took off. Turns out I had to pee for real so I got up and that was my dream.

Normally I can’t find my ticket or lose track of time is why I miss plane. I also never have helpers or get packed up as far as I did last night. The only thing that was holding me up from taking off this time was my bladder. The one time I did take off on the plane in the dream the windows were open and my pets were all stuffed in a crumbling cage bc they had to be in cages to be on the plane. This dream last night they were allowed on with leashes or without like
Mine that almost got left behind. I saw people get on with their dogs and they each had a dog leash on one red one blue. ￼

It can also be about some learning from life experiences that you were reflecting on.You have support of your parents in the dream but they can be representing your rational (dad) and emotional (mom) sides. You seem to be quite capable on your own and more worried about taking care of others than worried about yourself. Plane trips can represent life aspirations or spiritual journeys. With your daughter being almost left behind, left out in the cold and then feeling her warmth and having to pee it would seem you may have some feelings or worries about her growing independence that you dislike. She could also be representing an aspect of you and indicating that deep down you really do have some tentative feelings about your situation yet you seem to regain your center easily with the knowledge your family is there for you and you for them.",2022-04-24 14:55:27,1409026326285688,https://facebook.com/1409026326285688,905592076730541,Group member,"Lauren Wemmer I like that than you. The part with my daughter was weird in the dream though. it wasn’t her left out in the cold it was one of our pups. I could remember my daughter getting on the plane with my mom and sons. So All the sudden when she disappeared I wasn’t worried bc I knew she was safe with my mom and her brothers. The one left out in the cold was acutely one of my dogs.

Not to sound like an ass we have 5 pets and I love them all but she is definitely the naughtiest as in does dog things that suck. Like getting into garbages, food thief, chewing things up etc. dog kind things",2022-05-01 14:55:28

Then we were ready to take off but I told them I had to pee before the plane took off. The flight attendant was not happy bc I did the same thing last time before the plane almost took off. Turns out I had to pee for real so I got up and that was my dream.

Normally I can’t find my ticket or lose track of time is why I miss plane. I also never have helpers or get packed up as far as I did last night. The only thing that was holding me up from taking off this time was my bladder. The one time I did take off on the plane in the dream the windows were open and my pets were all stuffed in a crumbling cage bc they had to be in cages to be on the plane. This dream last night they were allowed on with leashes or without like
Mine that almost got left behind. I saw people get on with their dogs and they each had a dog leash on one red one blue. ￼

Thanks In advance for any input￼ and for sticking with me I know I have horrible spelling and grammar issues. 💟💡",2022-04-26 13:24:32,0.000000,2,0,1408098999711754,https://facebook.com/1408098999711754,1317912160,Lauren Wemmer,"Hello, the dorm could be about independence as college is a time in life when you move away from the support of family to live on your own and make your own decisions. It can also be about some learning from life experiences that you were reflecting on.You have support of your parents in the dream but they can be representing your rational (dad) and emotional (mom) sides. You seem to be quite capable on your own and more worried about taking care of others than worried about yourself. Plane trips can represent life aspirations or spiritual journeys. With your daughter being almost left behind, left out in the cold and then feeling her warmth and having to pee it would seem you may have some feelings or worries about her growing independence that you dislike. She could also be representing an aspect of you and indicating that deep down you really do have some tentative feelings about your situation yet you seem to regain your center easily with the knowledge your family is there for you and you for them.",2022-04-24 14:55:27,1409048049616849,https://facebook.com/1409048049616849,1317912160,Lauren Wemmer,Group member Dogs in dreams very often symbolize our family members or friends so it wasn't surprising to me that in the dream your daughter turned into your dog. It can just be an indication you love your dog just like family or it could be you find similarities between your pet and your daughter's actions or personality and the connection this has to you. In dreams the lines are often blurred and our minds lump a lot of things we find similar together. The end part with the dogs all having leashes that were either red or blue could have something to do with you or your family feeling the need to speak lovingly and calmly as a leash is a restraint in the neck area (the site of the throat chakra that governs communication) and the color blue relates to throat chakra again as well as the idea of calm while red is a color associated with love. the leash could also represent how you lead by example with your words and might just be a reflection of the compassion you show others.,2022-05-01 14:55:28

I had a dream about my auntie which my great auntie she's my grandma sister, and my granny is deacesed but anyway I had called my auntie on the phone her name was Bessie but she didn't answer she hasn't been answering since. She has been going back and forward to the doctor's and stuff she says she my have cancer and my granny died from it but I believe she will pull thru it. But in the dream she was shocked after I had called her when she didn't answer me and my old man that I'm with now we had went to her house and remind you! She lives in Winona Ms so we we're in saint Louis Mo, in the dream but some how I got to Winona Ms fast and went up there to see why she didn't answer her phone because in real life she hasn't been answering because she has been going back forward to the doctor's so the reason why I'm asking this me and my old man went up there she was getting out the tube and I had went in to look at the clock and she looked surprised about me coming up there with Carl so I don't know and when I call now she barely answer so what does that dream means?

She loves him unconditionally
that sometimes her soul cry’s, then in a moment of soberity during a time when they are separated he is reflecting on that connection and he realizes that he will never find a love more true, his heart opens but not because of his love for her but because of her love for him. That’s why he say because her love won’t let me lose her. He tries and tries to say a final goodbye, yet he search’s for that connection in other ppl, other activities but his soul won’t allow him to find her spirit, her energy in any other place, so they take this rollercoaster ride, the leaving and coming back and he realizes hopefully it’s not to late and he tells her either face to face or at the gravesite.",2022-05-01 14:55:41

It was either to show that I should have respect or that I’m taken or both. Then they asked if I was going to keep it cuz it was so weird. I wanted to keep it.

I believe that it may be time to stand up for yourself, stand in your power and speak your own truth. It might not be comfortable for you. When we are passive people and we try to be assertive, we feel like we are being aggressive. You can still be respectful of others and speak your truth. White owls in my experience mean some sort of change is coming that you were not expecting. I also view owls as messengers or bringers of intuitive insight, wisdom, a knowing of spiritual things. I think this is a wonderful dream. I think it shows that you are growing and opening up as a person. I hope that helps.",2022-05-01 14:55:45,,,,,,

The dream started out in a familiar house. Nothing was strange or anything just the people in the dream and myself chatting and having a good time. After a little bit inside we go outside. Everyone is just sitting there chatting as I am spaced out looking at the moon. Then I turn and tell everyone we are no longer on earth. Everyone asks me what I mean and I point. The moon I was spaced out into was 3 moons. The sky was a light pastel purple/blue and I tell everyone we are on Jupiter. Nobody believes me and tells me it was all just a reflection. I woke up after someone kissed me.

That is all that I remember from the dream, but it’s been one of them dreams that constantly have been running in my awake life so I’m curious on what anything about it could mean especially since it’s been twice with different people in less then a week.",2022-04-24 16:47:21,,1,0,1408967166291604,https://facebook.com/1408967166291604,100023865227789,Rita Catherine,The planet Jupiter represents expansion and everything going well.

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?""). Share the whole dream.",2021-08-14 06:44:34,76.000000,25,0,1282342492287406,https://facebook.com/1282342492287406,100000478473491,Tonya Perkins,Thanks for accepting my request.

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?""). Share the whole dream.",2021-08-14 06:44:34,76.000000,25,0,1254380438416945,https://facebook.com/1254380438416945,782889130,Emilia Toivonen,thanks for letting me join!,2021-10-08 14:55:52,,,,,,

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:55:53,1235685116953144,https://facebook.com/1235685116953144,100001037053553,Terry Dey,Elisah Meis I agree but we've noticed many of our dreamers arent always English proficient because its not their primary language so sometimes we have to work with it,2021-09-08 14:56:07

Along the way, I see a beautiful historic home and walk up to the back door. I peek inside a window and am impressed with what I see. Like Goldilocks, I go in the house, uninvited.

It is quirky, wide plank wood floors, built in cabinets, shelves, nooks and crannies with all sorts of antique collectibles, fireplaces in every room. The kitchen has copper pots and pans hanging from a metal rack. The entire house is a showcase.

There are children’s books open and strewn all over the living room floor. A narrow, steep staircase that leads to the second floor. I go upstairs and explore a bit. In a drawer I see some colored pieces of metal that look kind of like skinny bullets.

I leave the house and pass a couple with their two children on my way to the coffee shop. While I’m there, they come back to announce that someone has been in their house and stolen something.

They approach me and accuse me, but I don’t remember taking anything. I reach into my pocket and there are two of the metal pegs, one green, one gold.

I am scolded, and worry that I’ll be arrested. But, the man gets some kind of device and tells me he wants to show me something. The device looks like a juicer. He places the gold peg into a hole in the top and it squeezes out into a small pillow shape of soft foam.

I try to leave while people are distracted, but just then, my real life employer (who happens to be the cook at the cafe) says that she found a note that I wrote. She reads it out loud.

It says something about not being sorry for my actions and that if I hadn’t gotten caught, no one would be the wiser.

Just then I wake up.",2022-04-22 14:25:59,0.000000,1,0,1408978992957088,https://facebook.com/1408978992957088,100023865227789,Rita Catherine,Has anything happened at your work where you feel justified in what action you took?,2022-05-01 14:56:12,,,,,,

It's a dream about my grandparents and I travel to my grandma's friends house. We get the house tour then my grandma and her friend leave, grandpa takes a nap and I'm stuck on the couch with only a recorded sports show that works and their cats near me.

I dreamed I was a man with a female friend. She showed me her greenhouse solarium with beautiful healthy green plants and glass structure. Then led me outside through an open doorway. It was nighttime and the whole sky was filled with bright stars.

She cast a spell to bring out to make the inner self, the animus and homunculus, visible. She and I thought the spell was for herself and didn't work. But illuminated white ghostly figures appeared to me above, calmly pacing the green grass above us, with the stars in that background.

The ghostly figures were of a woman in white with a peaceful male lion.

I didn't understand and for a minute was agitated asking does anyone else see? The woman and a quiet little small dark terrier who was there barely seen like a friendly shadow they could not see the white figures above.

The woman became calm, content, and knowing as her spell had worked. It showed the inner self of me instead of herself

The images of the peaceful woman in white with the peaceful lion were similar to the Strength card in tarot

And the terrier reminded me of the dog in the fool card, meaning to trust the devotion of your own small shadow intuition and instinct which protects you from harm as you try new adventures innocently",2022-04-26 11:52:30,,1,0,1408762392978748,https://facebook.com/1408762392978748,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"Interesting dream.

I posted an anonymous post, didn’t mean for it to be anonymous. It was just about how I started dreaming daily about 8 months ago which is wierd and freaky anyways:

Dream last night.

I was at my ex bfs house “we split in real life 1.5 years ago, I had to leave because of DV” so in my dream I was at his house but it was mine. I think I was in school had to study or something. My study buddies came over and they FLEW over 😂I thought it was so cool and this guy can’t remember a face, taught me how to fly. I started flying everywhere around the neighborhood!! I saw him do a flip, so I tried one but I immediately fell to the ground because I was to fat. He told me to fly better I had to lose some weight. I then proceeded to fly around. I flew to the neighbors and started swinging one arm on a tree and they where shocked I could fly. I told him I got the vaccine moderna shot and if he got it to he may also be able to fly 😂. Anyways now I’m back at home inside and there is a fight across the street and the guy has a gun. I had to hurry and get my mom, neice and someone else inside this car but it was like a clown car 😂😂. We all got in and I made them stay real quiet and I hurried it out the front door and down the street, it was so stressful. I woke after that.

In real time I woke at 5AM to a beeping in my ear like a car door for 5 seconds, that freaked me out and I started thinking I was hearing things so I didn’t go back to sleep till 6.

Then I went back to sleep for 2 hours, I just woke up BUt! For the first time in my dream something wierd happened. I was hanging with my brother, (prior to this part of my dream I was doing something but I can’t remember what I was doing.)we where In his van and I STARTED TELLING HIM ABOUT MY DREAM… from when before I woke at 5AM 😂 so crazy! Then I went on to someone breaking into my car and she stole my stuff, she was homeless and with other people but also lives in a sober house. She gave me back one pair of shoes and I finally got the other one from her after threatening her. I took the box home and they where diff shoes. I took them back to her and freaked out on her yelling. Her and her friends started looking for the shoe. It was taking forever; she got in my face and I told her to get out of my face or I would fight her. She didn’t so I punched her but it was a slow punch, I hit her face where her glasses where and didn’t think it hurt her but she said OWE and started crying. We where all of a sudden in her sober house and I was talking a bunch of smack to her and her friends calling them low life’s. Then I told them to go get a drug and alcohol assessment and I helped them with resources 😂 the girl that needed to find my shoe left to find my shoe in a golf cart full of her stuff. So I asked her roommate where her other stuff was and she showed me bexause I was going to take some of her stuff as collateral until she got me my shoe. But it was all baby stuff and I didn’t wanna take her baby stuff. All of a sudden I was on the roof my mom was there and someone else idk who and I thought I was to fat for the roof and I was going to break it. Then all of a sudden it was not my real mom but it was my street mom and she was nice and helped me and showed me where the girls food was. I messed up her cupboards and took some of her food. (I have clients in real life for my job) one of my clients I haven’t heard from was in my dream and I told her you neeed to call me you are not in compliance and she shut the door on me. I was irritated but I left and remember thinking in my dream about daily stuff it’s wierd. Anyways I walk outside and it’s like a beautiful Christmas wonderland and these 2 men said hello to me really nice but I felt like they where only nice bexause they wanted me to buy things from the venders at the park… it was snowing… then I woke up.

Sorry if that was a lot. I left a lot out.",2022-04-24 17:21:21,0.000000,1,0,1408822666306054,https://facebook.com/1408822666306054,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"hmm the left out stuff could be significant.

What I'm picking up is a lesson you need to learn from your past relationship (your ex's school that is your school) and I suspect it relates to how you interacr with others (the second dream with talking smack to people in some way being tied to weight issues? Also tied to vaccines too? And trying to sell something for non-altruistic purposes...?",2022-05-01 14:56:29,,,,,,

I think it started over 5 years ago when my dad was put into a Care home but he died within 3 months of been in there February 2018 by my mum and brother and Auntie and cousin and family friend all involved they are still saying not very nice things about me and my husband. My mum and brother started this saying I did not want to help when I did. It is true I do not care for them as they so not care for me I still meet up with my mum but it is always negative also it was their flat and I think my mum did a will so that my brother stays in the flat which how it all started thank you for letting me know,2022-05-01 14:56:31,,,,,,

An older man I can’t really see was telling me how to pick those seashells. The level of the sea increased but I always had my feet on the ground, and the more the sea elevated the more seashells I gathered
There was a kind of wooden square, I was into this square and the sea was all around me

What could this mean ? 🤔",2022-04-26 23:41:55,1.000000,3,0,1408756959645958,https://facebook.com/1408756959645958,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"I think this seems to reflect maybe yoir intellect - considered a masculine aspect.

M mum passed very suddenly in 2012 it was really hard not being able to say goodbye and now at least once a month she is in my dream but I'm on my way to her and I never get to her before I wake up it's like my mind is not letting me see her.
Can anyone give me an insight into this dream please ❤️
Thankyou",2022-04-27 13:37:10,,1,0,1408091373045850,https://facebook.com/1408091373045850,1317912160,Lauren Wemmer,So sorry for your loss of your mom. The dream seems to be about your psyche missing that opportunity to say goodbye before she passed yet really wanting what is not possible. I wonder if you might write her a letter with all you would have said had you had the opportunity and speak the words aloud to your favorite picture of her if you think it would give you some peace? Sometimes engaging in ritual or ceremony can help us through these difficult times of our lives. Wishing you all the best.♥️,2022-04-24 14:56:45,1408702376318083,https://facebook.com/1408702376318083,1156765043,Joanne Finlay,Lauren Wemmer thankyou so much for taking the time I'm definitely going to write a letter I think that's a brilliant idea ❤️,2022-05-01 14:56:46

The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. 3 And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 4 These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes.

. In my experience, and judging by the amount of people experiencing much the same thing on the internet, seeing repeating numbers, typically 11:11 or 22:22 is a particular type of synchronicity that can often mark the beginning of what some people call a spiritual awakening, an unconscious process.

In the weeks leading up to a spontaneous mystical experience I had a couple of years back I experienced a ton of synchronicities
/
meaningful coincidences, and at their height they took on religious symbolism, for me this was Christian symbolism, including references to Bible verses, even though I was not religious. Dreams, synchronicities, religious symbolism and experiences are all behaviors of the unconscious. Synchronicities
, imo, often indicate some transformation of the psyche is imminent, or the you ego consciousness is weak, as it is when you're still walking up. If the synchronicities
get really common in daily life if your unconscious overpowers your ego consciousness I'd start to suspect you might be heading towards a spiritual awakening, a mystical experience, or in rare cases psychosis.

I started seeing 22:22 a lot a few years back. I have a friend that used to wake in the night at 2:22 and get sleep paralysis regularly. She saw 222 so often she got it as a license plate. She also went through a spiritual awakening/
psychosis. The last time we visited the number cropped up everywhere.",2022-04-24 14:56:57,,,,,,

When you see a reoccurring 3-4 number multiple times per day, write it down, you can look it up online for possible meanings (sometimes called angelic numbers), but you should take special note of what your consciousness was focusing on prior to seeing the number.

Further, were you not awake? Don’t you remember writing it down? If the phrase “Revelations 14” is all we have to go on, we’re not going to be able to help you find meaning in the phrase.

The room was my parents bedroom from growing up and his apartment was where the bathroom would have been. I was able to pull the door shut after I realized what was gonna happen. Then i froze a while before calling 911. Then the line died and i froze again before waking up.

Someone or something is threatening control over you. This could be a habit or a person. You are trying to keep separate from this experience or manipulation.

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?"").

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 14:57:25,1235685116953144,https://facebook.com/1235685116953144,100001037053553,Terry Dey,Elisah Meis I agree but we've noticed many of our dreamers arent always English proficient because its not their primary language so sometimes we have to work with it,2021-09-08 14:57:40

It's a dream about my grandparents and I travel to my grandma's friends house. We get the house tour then my grandma and her friend leave, grandpa takes a nap and I'm stuck on the couch with only a recorded sports show that works and their cats near me. They never state they have a son that lives with them but I eventually enter the upstairs looking for someone to help me shut the show off and I find their son my age. We start talking and making out then we have sex til his mom catches us then he brings girls over and it flashes to me being a ghost stuck in the house watching him be with girl after girl while I'm stuck watching the same recorded episode and ""petting"" the cats and me scaring the girls he brings home.

Left behind. Not given attention. You are a ghost because you are not visible to others. It is how you feel. Not seen. The sex with the boy is about how you are reaching out for connection and get dropped. He starts spending time with other girls and you are trying to get his attention is you looking for others to care about you. I see this dream as a sign that you should get professional help. This is a repeating theme that is best taken care of.

I was the right outfielder on my team.
I was playing without my baseball glove
I caught two high-fly balls in the same inning with my bare hands. After catching the ball I yelled “I caught it!!! I caught it!!! My teammates cheered after I caught the ball. After catching the ball the pitcher on my team pointed in the the direction to throw it at 1st base to get the runner out. Next inning I tried to catch a high fly ball but it bounced off the ground and over the fence for a ground rule double. I couldn’t climb over the fence. My teammate climbed the fence I got the ball. We didn’t let our opponent score in that inning. Next inning, one of their players tried to interfere with me. Then I woke up.

You recognize your important contribution. Not being able to go over the fence might indicate some boundaries you are unwilling or unable to cross in this work. You leave this up to others.

I took it to be symbolic of a raise in consciousness or awareness. Like in one dream I was going up some stairs while a skeleton was coming down the stairs toward me. So I think this was symbolic of the fear of death coming into my conscious awareness. As I was trying to bring up the feelings with the Sedona Method to release them.

I'm watching a football game on a large screen tv with my family.
My favorite football team is playing and about to run a trick play.
As the play starts, tornado sirens go off and there is all this confusion.
The camera guy is still focused on the player as the play is breaking down because of all the confusion.
He throws the ball to the ground and panics.
The camera then pans to the fans in the stands who are all just standing and watching this small funnel cloud go back and forth.
I keep scrolling at the TV ""it's a tornado, dumbasses! Take cover!"" While my kids are screaming in disbelief.

I had this dream in the night and remember the end clearly…

I was parking my car quickly as I was just dropping into a garage to ask something.

So reversing in but found myself not in a bay because somehow the lines were reflections from something , rather than drawn lines, which my car obscured so I pulled back out and reversed back into what was now a space.

A man was stood washing cars next to where I was as this was happening…

I had to also at the same time do a school drop off and met a family where the mum was carted around on a stretcher which was more like a ping pong table , but with felt fabric, in size and quite low to the ground.
She was cut in half by her hips. Sort of squashed rather than a clean cut.
There was no blood just brown marks and some missing body parts were spread about randomly on the stretcher.
She was naked but she looked like a mannequin.
Her husband and children were with her.

In waking life I am torn and my way forward is uncertain. I am trying to change my career path and work pattern and I worry about the future a little bit.

The school drops offs end this summer which is why I am able to do these changes in real life.

I do feel like the woman is I, but happy to hear other peoples feelings about this dream please.",2022-04-26 12:04:07,0.000000,1,0,1408369159684738,https://facebook.com/1408369159684738,100009042510759,Roy De Ruyter,This dream does reflect your struggles at the moment.

I'm not sure if this is the right group to ask but I will try anyway...

Years and years ago, when I was born a cousin in my family who was 3 at the time turned to her mom and told her out of the blue that I had just been born (exact day), I was a girl and she told her my name. (My name or gender wasn't known to anyone before my birth). Her mom told her that isn't true and I wasn't due yet (I was 4 weeks early).
My auntie later that day recieved a call from my dad who let her know i had been born that day and told them the gender and name (which my cousin had got correct). For years we have joked saying we have a psychic connection.

Last night, I had a dream that she came to my house and told me she was expecting a baby. I messaged her today telling her about my dream. I had the shock of my life today when she called me straight away and told me she is pregnant but hasn't let anyone know yet because she is only 8 weeks. She wasn't trying to conceive so I don't even know how this has come about in my mind whilst I was asleep.

Does anyone know of any information about this sort of stuff?

Thank you",2022-04-27 16:28:50,,1,0,1408337056354615,https://facebook.com/1408337056354615,100009042510759,Roy De Ruyter,You do have a connection. Psychic connection is on the light side.

Somehow accidently I hurt my sister and my father started applying bandages on her. Then I saw a rainstorm and just after that, a flood making water level as high, enough to cover up ground and 1st floor level. I saw a red car going to right if my house and starts struggling to get out the water (off course water already covered ground and 1st floor, no way to get our of water) and slowly starting submerging. However, the driver was able to open the car door and try to jump on one of the roof of the house whose tip was still not fully submerged, and he was successfull (car colour was red). As water level was rising and me and my family was still on 1st floor, I rushed in the rooms and try calling my father to come and go to upper level (my house has total ground, 1st, 2nd and 3rd level as a roof (accessible)) and I started collecting warm clothes, blanket with me to take to another level. But when I came out of the room, I saw water level gone down a bit (like 40%) and the current 1st level floor was safe and now there was no need to go to next level. Then, I saw the family and the guy (who successfully took out and jumped on the tip of other's house roof, mentioned earlier) in the balcony of same other's house.

Note: in real life, the other's house that I see and the house I was in are both real in real life. Others house is my neighbour s house.

A disturbing dream to have, but one which was interpreted positively, preceding a renewal of some sort.

While she would ride the horse, she would also carry him, because she was extraordinarily
strong.

If you know this story, I wonder if it has any relevance as a symbol for your dream

Adopting a horse for your rescue for example, might be about how you are rediscovering your childlike sense of wonder and adventure and extraordinary strength, by ""carrying"" this horse - by taking care of an animal, that traditionally, is considered to be of service to humans for farming or carrying humans. Instead, you will be taking care of and tending this horse.

If the horse is ""retired"" then the name of Pippis horse ""old man"" might be relevant

Horse - (and Pippi!) - keyword I think of is strength.

Oh I just noticed paint markings were on your dream horse - yes, in Pippi, the spots were painted on lol I do seem to recall that...

To have spots painted on, in this rescue horse scenario might be that the ""negative marks against this horse"" are superficial and artificial. ""Painted on"" as in falsified, the ""black marks"" against adopting this animal are not truly valid.

Possibly also there is a saying of being ""unable to change one's spots (or stripes)"" meaning that we cannot change who we are, who we appear to be, cannot change our nature.

This horse, however, it seems like it CAN change it's spots lol it can change its nature

Spots can also be a pun, if for example when you adopt the animal you will change its location. It might be the feeling that if you adopt it and change it's location, the negative marks on it's character are going to change

Horse... strength, speed, power... being burdened or saddled with responsibility or work, can also be about freedom if unsaddled, if it has blinkers on it could be about blindspot you have.

A bridle can be a pun for a wedding, and commitment

Wild horse can be a free spirit",2022-04-24 14:58:34,1407464616441859,https://facebook.com/1407464616441859,100078462727492,Nękø Nightfall,Nina Kaye She is an old pony who has retired. Thank you so much 😊,2022-04-24 14:58:41

If the horse is ""retired"" then the name of Pippis horse ""old man"" might be relevant

Horse - (and Pippi!) - keyword I think of is strength.

Oh I just noticed paint markings were on your dream horse - yes, in Pippi, the spots were painted on lol I do seem to recall that...

To have spots painted on, in this rescue horse scenario might be that the ""negative marks against this horse"" are superficial and artificial. ""Painted on"" as in falsified, the ""black marks"" against adopting this animal are not truly valid.

Possibly also there is a saying of being ""unable to change one's spots (or stripes)"" meaning that we cannot change who we are, who we appear to be, cannot change our nature.

This horse, however, it seems like it CAN change it's spots lol it can change its nature

Spots can also be a pun, if for example when you adopt the animal you will change its location. It might be the feeling that if you adopt it and change it's location, the negative marks on it's character are going to change

Horse... strength, speed, power... being burdened or saddled with responsibility or work, can also be about freedom if unsaddled, if it has blinkers on it could be about blindspot you have.

A bridle can be a pun for a wedding, and commitment

Wild horse can be a free spirit",2022-04-24 14:58:34,1407479163107071,https://facebook.com/1407479163107071,554421340,Nina Kaye,"You are so very welcome, I wish you much joy with your beautiful pony! 🐎",2022-04-24 14:58:41

And ""old man"" can also be a metaphor for a boyfriend or significant other. Or an actual older person

Sometimes I think of older people in dreams as ""future selves"" this might be a future you might wantto create for someone you think is strong, powerful and beautiful, who has ""marks against him"" that are falsified or superficial. Nękø Nightfall",2022-04-24 14:58:35,,,,,,

I dreamt that I was in a small city, walking around, then suddenly a big horse runs in the streets. The horse run straight to a glass window head first, an begun to bleed heavily from his neck. I said to some friend ""so sad he had to do that, now he's going to die"". It was suprising to me that the horse did not die. I think it transformed to a human (man) who wasn't kind to others, and who others were afraid of- but I wasn't.

I usually can figure out my dreams pretty well, but for about almost 3 weeks straight, I had dreams of people. Just people. People with faces and bodies that I’ve never met. Each night was different, but with more people, more strange faces. I think Mercury was in my ruling planet of Neptune at the time. A lot of planetary and sun flare involvement too.
Most of the time I was just a witness, other times, I was saying something, but those parts I cannot remember.
My first impression was that it was people of Ukraine. Although I was watching the news on occasion, I made it a point to stay away from all forms of news just to see if my dreams would change. It didn’t help.
Now, years ago when a Tsunami hit Sri Lanka, I had dreamed of being on a beach and running to get a mom and child off because they were playing and not noticing the wave coming. We didn’t make if off but I was holding them and sort of flying. And there were many flocks of birds and we were all going in the same direction. When I woke up, my husband was reading the newspaper and tells me a tsunami hit …. I think my heart went to my feet and he saw my expression and got concerned. Yes, I believe I was there and helping people pass, but all I have is terms I’ve read, “Lightworker”.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?""). Share the whole dream.",2021-08-14 06:44:34,76.000000,25,0,1235650413623281,https://facebook.com/1235650413623281,100001027268137,Elisah Meis,"I personally would prefer is members would make it their standard to add the following information for a better, more personal explanation.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...

I grab my daughter but bang my leg on the cabinet as I turn and then I go to run out the house. As I’m running out the house with my daughter in my arms, I call the dog and dog runs out with us and the fire also quickly follows behind us.
I’m assuming we was only ones in the house as I didn’t see my other children or my mother/brother who we also live with.
I try to call 999 but I keep calling 969 instead by accident. My neighbour appears at their door and runs in to get their phone.
I very abruptly wake up from this dream and my face is boiling like I’ve really just been there and I have a injury on the leg that I injured in my dream.

I was talking to him then something he said made me ask him, “what did you do?” I remember feeling like he was talking about me, but he tried to hide it. Then I realized the apartment complex is in poor condition, inside the apartment looks like a messy hoarder situation, and then I noticed several feral cats. I should’ve tried to help get the guy out, but I was primarily concerned about my safety, so I was cautiously trying to walk towards either the front door or back door (whatever felt safer). I woke up before I left because my brain doesn’t let me get harmed, and I woke up with a panic attack or at least anxiety. I do feel like I know who the person was, but I want to mention that I rarely ever know or feel any connection with anyone in my dreams (it’s usually like people are around, but they don’t feel real). I can’t accurately say if I’m right about who it is or any feelings associated with the person because I had to calm myself down and remind myself that I’m protected.",2022-04-27 12:42:22,0.000000,1,0,1408112859710368,https://facebook.com/1408112859710368,1317912160,Lauren Wemmer,"Apartments in dreams can be like a mindset of your that you view as not really authentically you, like you don't take full ownership of it. The guy can be representing something you did (you asking him ""what did you do?"" ) and so the interior of the apartment is a reflection of how you feel about whatever that was. Hence you feel you are kind of a mess and the feral cats might be some cattiness that felt out of control or unlike you. Cats can also represent female sexuality, introversion or intuition among other things. The fact they are feral in the dream suggests you were judging yourself for not attending to them and letting your more animalistic urges run free. Basically, I think you woke up with anxiety because there was some situation in your life that you think you should have behaved differently but we are often our harshest critics so perhaps the dream is indicating to give yourself the compassion/
help you thought you should show the guy in the dream. This is how I read the dream but there can be many interpretations
so if this doesn't resonate look for others' responses.",2022-04-24 14:59:19,,,,,,

To explore the fear it is a ""fear of abandonment"" and a worry also about belonging and stability.

You had mentioned Skie Sarfaraz that in previous dreams your husband has been ill. It might be that in this time of family illness, and the focus on illness and death and absence generally in the pandemic, your son is having a fear of loss or abandonment, a feeling of instability or lack of belonging. I think many people are feeling this way in general at this time, in the pandemic isolation.

At the same time, the pandemic has given us ""separation anxiety"" from the few people that we do see on a daily basis - if the social group we see has shrunk, there is even more pressure on those relationships, we can get ""clingy""

The people who are going to take him home is both a part of the fear and also the antidote to the fear. The idea is that he has the concept that even if he has to face loss, he will not actually be alone, he will always be loved and cared for. However, there may be anxiety about how will he form a close bond with those others to feel stability and sense of belonging.

The idea though that they were ""taking him home"" is a truly positive antidote of a healthy inner person.

Your son is able to understand that he has a core feeling of safety and comfort, ""feeling at home with himself"" that IS constant, no matter who else is with him.

There are different things like mindfulness, meditation, and often actually in martial arts can bring this sense of a calm centre. That could strengthen this in your son, it can help to handle difficult life uncertainties of this time period with resiliency.

Also though, look at finding ways to fuel the bond of intimacy with you and your son over the next little bit to try to answer these fears. To read a special book to him at night to go to sleep perhaps, or to rub his back as he falls asleep, or to sing to him as he falls asleep.

It might be that if there is a lot that is calling on your stress or attention, that he is feelong a sense of ""distance"" from you which is not intentional on your part, but likely just a lack of ""being in the moment"" with focus on him, if there is other things calling on your attention or mood.

To try to look up this issue you can do a search of ""separation anxiety""; ""fear of abandonment"" and likely the key one is ""anxious attachment in children"" and see if that gives you any ideas about your son...

💙 hope these ideas help! They are just ideas, if it isn't helpful, please discard them",2022-04-24 14:59:24,,,,,,

If you are also the driver, as some dream interpretations
suggest, it is your intense focus and drive that will get you over obstacle, but it has to paired with a go with the flow attitude as well, this balance will do it.

Otherwise, it is someone in your life that you are offering counterpoint to - their intense drive, and your going with the flow, this is having success against all odds.

I think of also the idea of a ""steep incline""

Inclination - can mean a desire or character habit. Is there something that you are VERY much not normally inclined to do (you are only 5% inclined to do this) and yet you are having success because of your intense drive to do it, paired with your going with the flow, possibly allowing others to take the main lead?

I was sexually abused by my uncle back in 2011 he served time in prison and was released by 2015. Never heard from him since, neither has anyone in the family. Not had a bad dream or flashback etc since then either.
Last night I woke suddenly at around 3:30 from a horrible dream.
I had my cousin round (uncles daughter) my home and what I believe must be her new boyfriend. I knew it was a male that was with her but didn’t see his face. Then there was a knock at the door so I’ve gone to open it and a older man has barged past me and gone straight into my front room. I’ve followed to 1- see who they are and 2- see what on earth there doing.
It’s my uncle who abused me going to talk to his daughter, he was shouting a lot but I couldn’t understand what about. He was trying to get her to leave with him but she started crying and ran out the house and the male ran out after her. This left me and my uncle alone. He started having ago at me and how I sent him down after he begged me not to and that he would of just left and not spoke to me again. I tried to get run out and got to the hallway but he grabbed me by my arm and pushed me into my bedroom. He pushed me onto the bed and then he had a saw just waving it about. He was muttering and pacing back and forth in front of the door. There was a bang by the front door opening and then a gun shot and then I woke up.
Can someone try and figure this out for me please as it’s really triggered me and I’ve spent the past few hours googling what it means but failing.",2022-04-27 08:19:47,1.000000,1,0,1407812619740392,https://facebook.com/1407812619740392,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"The house as consciousness, I'm wondering if something has happened to soneone else that has made your past experiences intrude into your conscious awareness?

I'm not sure, but the saw seems significant, maybe this experience, symbolised by him, is threatening or in the act of immobilising you (thrown to bed and assuming the saw as neing to remove limbs, limbs being symbols of takung action). It could also be a play on words linking to what you ""saw""?

The daughter could be a symbol for someone who can ""relate"" to this experience hence may not be a family member? In fact she could even be a symbol of part of your character, perhaps unwanted or aggressive advances being shot down because of your past experiences? Not necessarily forced but even just moving too fast as dreams can exagerate?

Keep in mind these are just some ideas of top of my head and may not resonate, could certainly be seen in different ways.",2022-04-24 14:59:48,,,,,,

(I’d like to also add that I’ve never left the country or gone to USA and i have never spoken to this lady)

I dreamt of going to the USA to visit this lady off a page I follow. I don’t know how I got there because I didn’t have a passport, and mind me I’d just woken up and I was there. I remember having a coronary about the fact that my mum would freak If she knew I was in a completely different country.

But anyway, I was there with this lady and we’re chatting (I can’t remember what we were talking about though). After that I was back at this place I was supposed to be staying at and I remember talking to the people who were in the house. I was saying that I don’t know how I got there without a passport and not sure how I’ll get back either. Then a lady replied with I don’t care then all of a sudden a memory appeared in my head of being at the airport but they hadn’t even asked for my passport and let me through.

I don’t remember how but all this stuff we have here was at this place I was staying at and I saw these two cats that looked exactly like mine. I was worried that they were my cats and how I was gonna take them back along with this Ute and all the rest of it.

So In the next part of this dream I was with the lady again and we were travelling back via MK II Oppressors (futuristic bike that can hover and fly). We travelled back through some mountains and remember seeing these people and all this secret stuff happening. We hid so they couldn’t see us and when they left I noticed diamonds.

But it could be about having (or not having) authority to go on this journey. Just finding yourself where you are at.

This person you follow could be key to that as a symbol of inspiration or what interests you, like discoverong a passion?

I would be looking at the symbol of the United States not as a geographic place but a symbol of the State in which you find yourself psychologically

(I’d like to also add that I’ve never left the country or gone to USA and i have never spoken to this lady)

I dreamt of going to the USA to visit this lady off a page I follow. I don’t know how I got there because I didn’t have a passport, and mind me I’d just woken up and I was there. I remember having a coronary about the fact that my mum would freak If she knew I was in a completely different country.

But anyway, I was there with this lady and we’re chatting (I can’t remember what we were talking about though). After that I was back at this place I was supposed to be staying at and I remember talking to the people who were in the house. I was saying that I don’t know how I got there without a passport and not sure how I’ll get back either. Then a lady replied with I don’t care then all of a sudden a memory appeared in my head of being at the airport but they hadn’t even asked for my passport and let me through.

I don’t remember how but all this stuff we have here was at this place I was staying at and I saw these two cats that looked exactly like mine. I was worried that they were my cats and how I was gonna take them back along with this Ute and all the rest of it.

So In the next part of this dream I was with the lady again and we were travelling back via MK II Oppressors (futuristic bike that can hover and fly).

I was there for vacations, in my old house (now sold in real life because the area it was in became too polluted). But my house was also my high-school (which were nowhere near in real life). And I was hiding in my mother's room because I was depressed and wanted nothing to do with school. But I was still a teenager and my partners were still at school. Except my best friend Johnpi, who joined me in my mother's room to investigate... a murder. He needed a calm place to do that, so he skipped school. And he appreciated my help. He asked our classroom's nerd (who wasn't actually the classroom nerd in real-life) to give us copy in the math homework and she agreed. The whole classroom was very supportive of our endeavour, unlike in real-life. To skip gym class, the guys pretended to fall and get hurt to keep the teacher busy so she would not notice our absense. Oh, and this teacher was both the math and the gym teacher, in real life she was a literature teacher I had in university.

Fast-forwards, my mother complained I didn't go out enough, and that I should. I was depressed and didn't want to go anywhere, but said I would go out if my other best friend Angel agreed to meet with me. So I called him, told him I was in town, and asked if he would like to meet. He very excitingly accepted. ""Great! Should I bring something?"" I asked, excited too now, wondering if I should bring my Switch so we could play Pokemon.

Then I woke up. I neither solved the murder nor got to see Angel. But I still had a happy feeling.",2022-04-02 00:37:40,0.000000,1,0,1388296785025309,https://facebook.com/1388296785025309,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"I wonder if this is in relation to avoiding some lesson from your past (hiding from the teacher in school)?

A little backstory. I take care of my little brother, but we have been having a lot of behavioral issues with him at home and school, he also does not respect me or my husband.

Last night I had a dream, and we were at the house and decided we needed to go to the store for a couple things, I caught my brother leaving the door unlocked so I told him and my mom to go ahead of me and I locked everything behind me. We go to the store get what we need and head outside, my mother and I saw something we wanted and told my brother to go get in the car. We came out 2 minutes after him and I put the stuff in the car look in the back seat and the door is open but he is gone. I begin to freak out and we start to drive around while trying to call the cops when he comes out of no where all beat up. We begin to drive him to the hospital when he tells me it’s cause the house was locked and the robbers couldn’t get in. I felt panicked and upset.",2022-04-26 16:40:53,0.000000,1,0,1407096323145355,https://facebook.com/1407096323145355,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"Its interesting that he got beat up because the house was locked. That seems key to the dream and might help the meaning click.

The real question Im not sure about is whether brother represents your brother or, if in the dream he represents a part of you...

Also locking the house I think might actually about being/feeling secure, so maybe it is pointing towards where being secure is actually creating some negative consequence?",2022-04-24 15:00:08,1407120723142915,https://facebook.com/1407120723142915,1803028597,Victoria Nikole Roberts,Timothy Kippo hmm I could see that but I can’t pinpoint where I’m being extra careful about anything or recently trying to secure something. I am pregnant and having a baby soon so I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it.,2022-04-24 15:00:09

I had a dream he married his wife twice but he actually didn’t marry her twice at all. He actually married what it looked like someone else to me instead of her. This is his second marriage. He was jogging on the highway and I heard him calling someone name in the projects across the highway. Him and his wife got married in the backyard. He got in the car and left to speak with the older lady in the projects.

Maybe your not the same person you were when you married, and your beginning to recognise that.

Getting married twice suggests there is some new stage of commitment to each other. The marriage taking place in the backyard i feel means its of low importance or kept private somehow.

Jogging on the highway towards the projects, maybe you feel your husband has other projects that take him away from the marriage somehow, work or hobbies that he is involved with.

I wonder if you feel your husband feels differently about you.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?"").

My teen daughter told me she had a dream of a depressed 5 yo girl has committed suicide. She said tried stopping her but no one believed her, and the dream ended up the lil girl killing herself unfortunately.

This gave me chills. There were some things going on in her life when she was 5 ish and probably traumatized her indeed.

Based on our traumas we all develop subconscious coping mechanisms, filters that we experience life through. These anchorages hamper our ability to fully experience and contribute to life.

As I see it, a loving and nurturing environment has allowed her to safely let that wounded self die. When I read the first line of your post I wanted to ask if she had had any trauma at that age. You already mentioned further down that she did so I truly believe that she needs lots of long hugs, and earthing.

Yes.
Dream Memories to keep and not to let go.

My father never spent time with me in childhood … until my late 50’s untill he died. We had 3 years total together from 2014-2017. He didn’t recognize me because I was a senior citizen.

Any thoughts on this? Why I also had a dream about cats, across the street at night, standing on their hind legs really tall. Then fighting. One was clearly getting the best of the other. Looked like he had ahold of the other, pushing him back. Then a 3rd joined in. Looked like a tug or war going on.",2022-04-24 15:01:02

Dreams often relate to waking life anxieties. So one possibility is the cats represent a clash or disagreement you're dealing with. Cats can sometimes also represent feminine figures (but not always).,2022-04-24 15:01:02

And was wondering on anyones views. I was in my backyard and it was filled with birds an other lil critters . Was laying on the grass and look over to seenthis large monitor lizard and noted its invasive and needs to be captured. I figured id take care of the guy and had moved him to a bucket in my yard while I looked for a cage on my house. When i came back outside all the animals are noisy and tossin a fit. I look to the bucket and some blonde woman who looked very hippish was snickering and waveing her hands around the bucket. So i took off twords her an the lizard was drowned in water. I pulled him out an begin trying to bring him back to life pumpin his chest turnin him upside down an all that. Soon he woke and a held hom close patting his back an sayin i care about you guy. I wont let snyone hurt you. And got into a car an drove off. Thats where it left off. I woke up to a call.. (thanks in advance. Really stuck in my head),2022-04-25 20:18:00,0.000000,1,0,1406347423220245,https://facebook.com/1406347423220245,100009042510759,Roy De Ruyter,I see this as a positive dream. You saving the lizard is about doing something that is about saving yourself. This also could be about you having a lizard totem as something new for yourself.

Context : My dad got remarried a few years ago after our mom passed. me and my siblings didn’t like his wife. I moved out first then the rest of them did the same. Ever since I’ve never talked nor seen any of them again. It’s been about 3 years. One of my brothers was abusive. Let’s call him brother 2.

Warning : long read

dream started at what looked like a train station. I was in line waiting for my tickets and carrying my luggages. i got my tickets and was just walking to my station. I suddenly saw brother 1 and immediately panicked thinking.. “why is he here??!” so I decide to take another route. everything seemed good until eventually we made eye contact. I dropped my bags and started running as he chased after me. We then got into a crazy chase. at one point he was able to catch up and grab me asking me to come back home cause mom will miss me. I said no and yanked his arm off of me and eventually got away. Scene suddenly changes to him as he stares at me while I’m getting away then he goes on his phone texting brother 2.. “it’s up to you now.” scene changes back to me as I’m driving around figuring out what I should do next. I decided to stop at what looks like an apartment complex. I started walking around then horror strikes as I saw brother 2. He politely asked me to stop running away and come back home cause mom misses me. I started thinking in my head calling his act a bluff as he was always abusive. I didn’t say anything as I turned around and started running. Then we also got into what seems like a crazy chase. eventually he got a hold of me and started violently trying to get me to come home. He started pulling me hair beating me then I finally managed to get his hand off and escape. I then met this strange man. ( who I don’t know and never seen in real life. ) he told me that he saw the chaos and can help me then proceeded to tell me that the building secretly hold organ auctions and that he can pretend to put me in. It sounded dangerous and really sketchy but I was desperate and said ok. so I followed him into a room as he helped me changed and get dress for what seems like surgeon clothes. Then I laid on a bed as he rolled me into this creepy looking room. So in this room I saw a lot of people who was asleep and indeed looked exactly like what he said it was. In the process of taking in all this horror, Out of nowhere brother 2 came, made a commotion, and punched the guy that was pushing me. I was so scared that I just got up and ran back outside to my car and drove off. dream suddenly changes to what seems like a school. I was parking my car and was making my way up to the elevator then this girl by the name of Victoria ( again I never met or know this women. ) came up to me saying I should’ve gone home and see my parents as they miss me. Turns out she’s someone who lives with our family I’m assuming. I ignored her and went up the elevator. Dream scene then again changes to me sitting in a room with two men who I never met and don’t know. We were all just sitting and talking about our lives. Nothing too personal just the basics. they also started asking things like if I liked being a teacher there I said yes. eventually it was getting dark and the two guys was still there. I started thinking to myself why are they still there?? Do they know my bothers?? Are they purposely stalling?? But I brushed it off as my paranoia. Then I excused myself and was making my way to my car then suddenly I saw someone was driving my car. I immediately panicked and thought my brothers found me but then car suddenly parked in front of me and turns out it was one of the guys that was talking to me earlier and said “sorry I thought this was my car.”

I can control my dreams whenever I want as I am always aware I am dreaming. Lately I've just been letting them play out without interfering, but while something's seem pretty clear I've had two dreams recently that I think mean more. In both one or two grey wolves are guiding me to information, I know it's information.
One dream there are two large grey wolves, walking beside me, looking up at me smiling while I rest my hands behind each of their necks. They bring me to my ancestors who share the same eyes as me, bright shining pinkish eyes. There are many all over the hills waiting for me and looking up at the night sky full of stars. But I wake up not understanding any of that.
Then this weekend I dreamt a grey wolf led me to a clearing in the woods at night to show me something in the night sky. I can't remember what exactly he was showing me but in my dream I lift up my arm to point at the sky as if to ask, ""You want me to see this?"" but when I turn my head to look where I'm pointing I see my arm but it has the sillouette of a grizzly bears arm and hand, fingers, nails. As I moved my hand around it moves with me, now I see that the bear sillouette is spirit and that it is a part of me. I feel strong like feminine, mother, protector, supernatural strong as I realize I am the Bear. It felt like the bear was waking up in me.

This means that you need to reconcile your ""old"" concepts of masculinity and sexuality with your evolving new concepts of masculinity and sexuality.

The dream shows that you're not fighting your own growth ie you are not unconditionally
anchored into any concepts, but following your sacred innate curiosity regarding yourself to evolve and grow as a Human Being.

This implies an empowered and healthy young Masculine energy employing his powers of discernment and courage freely. It also points towards a healthy Feminine because of the receptivity and openness running parallel to the discernment and courage.

You are (becoming) more responsive and less reactive, more empathetically detached and less indifferent.

This dream is showing a smooth growth, smooth spiritual ascension. This means your environment is conducive to your growth. This means your instincts may be fine tuned enough to subconsciously adjust to your environment and vice versa.

Your feelings regarding the dream are highlighting old Ego anchorages that you will automatically lose over the next few months (it used be ~2 years but things are moving much faster nowadays).",2022-04-24 15:01:44,,,,,,

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?"").

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?"").

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 15:01:50,1235685116953144,https://facebook.com/1235685116953144,100001037053553,Terry Dey,Elisah Meis I agree but we've noticed many of our dreamers arent always English proficient because its not their primary language so sometimes we have to work with it,2021-09-08 15:02:04

I have had multiple dreams of my late husband. They are not feel good dreams and I remember pieces of them.

In one, he is just screaming bad names at me and is very upset. There is not any violence just a screaming match and I just stand there and take it.

In another one, we were out at a park and he was there with someone else and I told him he needed to choose and he chose the other person. Which then led to me screaming at him. One of the things I said was she is only 24! How could you? Then I told him I was going to take everything and I meant everything and then he was like just leave me now.

I have had multiple dreams of him having other partners but none ended with him telling me to go.

What could these mean?

We had (I think) a stable relationship and we were together for a total of 28 years before he passed away.

In your dream he is moving on and telling you to let him go. Maybe it is your subconscious ""screaming"" at you to let him go and move on with your life. I know when a loved one passes it sometimes feels like you're not supposed to feel happy anymore because they are gone and moving on with your life would feel like a disrespect to their memory. I felt like that when my dad passed so I can imagine that feeling would be even stronger with a spouse. Maybe your dreams are about your inner conflict where you are torn between grieving him and wanting to stop grieving but feeling like you are supposed to grieve forever. Also, if you believe that loved ones can visit you in your dreams from the other side, it could be taken as a message from him that he wants you to move on and be happy without him. If you had passed instead of him, would you want him to be miserable and miss you for the rest of his life or would you be screaming at him from the other side to find happiness and live for the both of you? Just a thought. The other woman he left you for in your dream could just symbolize him leaving you in this world to be in the next. Even though it wasn't his choice to leave you in reality, that doesn't mean you don't hold anger inside at losing him, whether that anger is at him, or God, or the universe, pain often presents itself in the form of anger. It isn't fair that you lost him, and you feel wronged. Anger is a stage of grief. If you haven't processed your grief fully in your waking life, it will come out in weird ways in your subconscious. I have bizarre dreams of my dad all the time too.",2022-04-24 15:02:08,,,,,,

You say you had a stable relationship and that he was sick during the last year when you gave all of yourself to him. This experience may hold some shadows of self blame, a feeling of not having done enough as is common for many people who take care of their spouses or other relations through a terminal illness. The caretakers question themselves and engage in self-criticism and self judgment..

The age 24 may be implying a few things. It could be that his health started declining 4 years before he passed, it could be implying a significant experience you had at the age of 24.

You have a sense of losing precious time together, there may be a fear of loneliness. Him leaving you behind is being perceived by some part of your Heart as his betrayal, but you're assuming you share the ""blame"" even as a victim of his betrayal, even in spite of all you did to help.

I see these as the dreams of a Heart on the mend. Life, Death, we don't perceive much beyond the limits of our 5 senses, it doesn't mean nothing exists beyond Life and Death.

He will reach through with increasing clarity as you continue moving upwards, on this spiral of individual growth across time we Humans have the privilege of experiencing as Life on Earth.

You sound like an extremely devoted, loyal, committed, and sincere partner, someone who stands with her companion and doesn't let go when they're drowning.

Some part of our Heart hopes and prays that our input would yield results that would at least partly be based on our deepest desires (you'd have wanted the both of you to stay together forever).

You did everything you could, perhaps some part of you wonders if he did all he could.

Allow yourself to heal. Try to recall your best and healthiest times together.

Write letters to him..

Sending you Love.",2022-04-24 15:02:08,,,,,,

Getting too far off the ground. You may need to not try to overdo things. The bus tipping over is some kind of lessons not turning out. The same thing with the ship sinking. Symbolizes your lessons or your goals not working out. With the skyscraper in the beginning is you are trying to accomplish too much. Too high with the dizziness. I feel this dream is saying to take smaller steps in accomplishing your goals with the nightmares. I feel there are steps to your healing this.,2022-04-24 15:02:11,,,,,,

A massive grey tornado heading straight for my town. I was scared but also excited because I’d never seen one in real life. I was watching from a window in a tall building, as I tried to look closer I realized I had walked onto a ledge outside the glass. I quickly returned inside.
The scene switched to a different room. I found two snakes on the floor. One was a boa, the other a python. Both looked in very poor health, one badly burned and the other with skin peeling off. I felt badly for them and wasn’t sure what to do.

Whether that be relationship or job related or something else...its something you are striving for that has potential to fail. But you are clearly in control of it either way.

I hope someone can help me to interpret it. I dreamt that a couple committed suicide. They both jumped from a building. But the building was odd. It was a building that was under construction and the whole face of the building was missing. Just imagine looking at a doll house where you could see every floor and every room. That’s the way the building looked. But there was a long black screen draping the front of the building. The police were there, trying to talk the couple out of jumping. They were unsuccessful. The woman pushed the screen and jumped, and the man jumped right after her.

So these people could symbolize aspects of yourself that are changing. There might be a part of yourself that your changing or putting an end to. The police could symbolize the part of you that is trying to stop it from happening and keep those aspects alive. The dream is showing that this part of you was unsuccessful. It's possible that the two people are symbolic of someone else you know who is changing out putting and end to an old aspect of themselves. And the police - the side of yourself that's trying to stop it. A house often represents the self. Your self is under construction - being worked on. And you can see into every part of the self because it's missing a wall. So you're perhaps being transparent? But yet there is this black screen covering the face of the building. So maybe you are trying to conceal the fact that you are under construction or working on yourself.

My thoughts are thaf the dream is about the way you are progressing with your life. You know you need to clean things up.

Perhaps you have some conserns that you are headed towards a risky or volatile future in some way. And this is a future to which you know you dont belong.

The engine I feel is about your inner self and your own personal source of power. What is if that makes ""your motor run""? What is if that gets you going in life, that gives you drive and motivation? Have lost your motivation for life? Do you need a tune up, because your dream suggests you need to clean this up too! Water can of course represent emotions and healing. Washing is a symbol of cleasing. The attendant is a part of you, the part that needs to pay attention and ""attend"" to these inner parts so you move forward with power.

When you ""clean up"" this attendant part knows you will be fine.

The bike suggests that you need to become more indipendant and to focus on your own very personal journey in life. There maybe some ghosts from yoyr past that also need busting in order for you to do this.

I feel the job you must do is to get some help and support. Who can you recruit or employ, to help you bust these ghosts? Perhaps a therapist or councellor?

The cave is an ancient symbol for the inner dark caverns of our own self. The place where our shadow self hides. All the parts that we reject and repress, all the parts of our own selves that cause us trouble. Parts that have been hurt, insecurities, shame, anger etc. The witch and her husband suggest a sense of ""evil"" or badness you perhaps feel inhabits your own darkness. There is a clear family unit here too so there could be some links to you'd own family or upbringing.

In my opinion this is a powerful dream that calls you to do some personal work and healing. I wish you courage in your efforts.",2022-04-24 15:02:20,,,,,,

The bee can be a symbol of hard work or working as a team. The drones serve their queen and they all work together for to provide for the community and their offspring.

The tickling I feel is the dreams way of saying there is an irritation here. Something is bothering you. This irritation you would like to be rid of but it has ""floored you"" somewhat.
I feel you are worried that you will get to point where you will do something impulsive. The be walking on your throat is a prompt for you to talk about whatever it is about your ""bee-ing"" that is bothering you.",2022-04-24 15:02:25,,,,,,

Mother = life force and instinct.
Bathtub = hygiene and relaxation. Perhaps, all that has been taken for granted and expected is being suffocated by new environmental elements that require specialized tools in which to survive.
Grandmother = matriarchy and practical wisdom. Without lungs there is no breath, there is no voice. The new is being stifled by the old.

(My waking life consists of me trying to get my upgrading and education done to be a vet and I do have a black cat that is (I 90% believe) pregnant)

So, the night before last I dreamed about my cat giving birth and I was also trying to go to school and i was trying to go to the dentist (I can't remember the full dream, but that's what it included)

Last night, I dreamed that my cat was giving birth again but this time we were in a hospital and the male doctor came and checked on us but we were there for a different reason. Then, I had a ""friend"" there that was pregnant and delivering her baby. When I found out my cat was giving birth i felt like i had to hide and save her so i rush her home then i come back to the hospital for my friend. When I returned she gave birth to 21 babies! 🤯 then when I returned to my cat she gave birth to 6 babies.

After the first dream, I felt like I had to ""grow up"" more and be a ""true"" adult. Like right now I'm just going through the phase.

The 2nd dream when I woke up I was in a bit of disbelief of what I saw. The guy doctor was really good looking (never seen him before), and I was kind of excited but a bit stressed about the kittens.

Everything that I've found online isn't making much sense, so I thought I would come here and see.

The thing that comes to me prompted by your comment, is to check what had been passed to you from your mum 's side (what general beliefs/
thinking patterns) that may be causing any form of addictive behaviour. For example we may be addicted to suffering /pain.. So the dream is alerting you to something that need looking at and using this strong imagery to get your attention.",2022-04-24 15:02:43,,,,,,

You say you spoke only to your father as he arrived at the scene when you saw the mess. You spoke about cleaning up the place. This to me indicates that you are using your power of discernment and action to engage in shadow-work. Shadow-work is about facing our shadows and cleaning up our psychological anchorages. It requires focus, courage, will power, determination, and discernment. These are all aspects of the Masculine side of the energy spectrum. The Father indicated that you'd be falling back on your learned Masculine ways to engage in this work. The Feminine side is about openness, acceptance, tolerance, patience etc. That remained in the background in your dream along with the young Masculine. You're engaging a specific section of your mind to do this inner work.

The pigeons may symbolize your natural self, the unconditioned self trying to shine through your conditioned self. Excrement of any form in dreams is usually symbolic of creativity so your dream would imply you have immense potential waiting to be unleashed, which without active channeling has led to a scattered mess within. Perhaps the element of shyness or conditioning of ""right and wrong"" is playing a part in you stifling some aspects of yourself.

You remove the ""curtains"" to clean them. That's symbolic of voluntarily uncovering the deeper wounds, the deeper self, and also symbolic of being open to Light (to enlightenment, to self-awareness)
by willingly uncovering the access to your own Self.

As there was more Light, you did see more of what you needed to ""clean"". This naturally happens when we go down this path of actively engaging in our spiritual ascension through shadow-work. More and more comes to light that needs to be transmuted.

In each moment in life, we deal with the issue at hand to the best of our knowledge, capacity, and intentions at that given point. This may lead to discovering things that would leave us feeling demotivated, but our Masculine energies of persistence and courage always come in handy.

The dream was interrupted, but I believe it has conveyed to you the message it carried. You're subconsciously growing into a new person because the global environment has been changing drastically, yet on some levels imperceptibly. The same dynamic is being reflected in all individuals based on our unique circumstances.

Depending on how your life may have been changing (I didn't see an indication of turbulence, just natural smooth ascension and growth), the dream indicates that you're actively finding ways to express your true self in spite of how things may appear initially.

I always suggest earthing and grounding, and I also suggest visualization meditation to feed especially the Heart Chakra with the intention that the Heart will strengthen the other six. I also recommend aiming for at least 3 litres of water a day. It really helps with the process somehow.",2022-04-24 15:03:04,1404945526693768,https://facebook.com/1404945526693768,100025634782553,Paula Coker,"Sarah B Gillani thank you so much, I knew a house represents our bodies as such and looking up at the ceiling did indicate to me the mind.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?""). Share the whole dream.",2021-08-14 06:44:34,76.000000,25,0,1235650413623281,https://facebook.com/1235650413623281,100001027268137,Elisah Meis,"I personally would prefer is members would make it their standard to add the following information for a better, more personal explanation.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

It was a nightmare, but I think it’s legitimately the most vivid dream I’ve ever had in my life. And I already dream vividly regardless. So this was really intense. I’m not gonna bother trying to explain it because it’s too hard to explain. It literally felt like I was in an alternate universe, and that this stuff is still going on in the dream world right now as I type this. I wanna go back to that dream to see what happens. I feel like the people in the dream need help, and they’re all dying while I’m still awake.

EDIT: I decided to add a quick summary of *most* of the dream. This isn’t the full thing obviously, just a brief explanation because there are honestly too many things going on and too many strong emotions to cover.

In said dream I was part of some unit made up of child soldiers (except I wasn’t child, the others were) called the “F.S.W unit” or something like that, where all the kids line up and start filing in to this platform in the middle of a huge arena where there’s crowds all around watching, and once they get to the platform it’s like Russian roulette where there’s a 50/50 chance that a few will end up dying.
The way they end up dying is that Chucky (you know, the creepy doll) runs around underneath the platform with his hand out, grabbing the kid’s hands, and if the kid squeezes his hand back then he sentences them to death by chasing after them with a huge knife.
I eventually caught onto this, so I stopped squeezing his little hand whenever he’d put it out and he was like “fucksakes, this bitch is gonna be a tricky one” or something (sorry for the language).
Then I had a military uniform on and gear and had to crawl/run really fast throughout a series of tunnels that my bedroom was connected to in order to get away.
Then my boyfriend was there, but can’t really remember what he was doing. I was sitting in fetus position up against a wall with all my stuff on and I just remember him bending down in front of me and saying something, but I had PTSD and was confused.
Then when Chucky captured me, I sprouted wings and transformed into some purple bird god named “Raksha” and was able to get away and they were like “It’s the second coming of Raksha! All hail!” Or something.",2022-04-17 02:04:23,0.000000,3,0,1399062153948772,https://facebook.com/1399062153948772,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"My thinking in this is it is like an inner dimension that reflects what is going on within.

I'm not sure, at first i thought the military uniform was hinting at conflict but on reflection I think it is about discipline - and using discipline to overcome a fake (Chucky doll) self destructive pattern of behaviour, particularly aroubd learning not to indulge in what appears to be offered as a symbol if caring/love/
support (Chucky's hand) but really isn't.

So overcoming that allows transformation and empowerment is how I read the end if the dream. Maybe freedom in a sense with those wings allowing escape.",2022-04-17 15:03:38,1399063397281981,https://facebook.com/1399063397281981,100066906024250,Willow Rae,Timothy Kippo interesting.

purpose, if we can identify and accept it.
You said you are sensitive and this can be crippling in itself sort of like overdialed emphathy (also hospital reference) but the dream may be saying ""communication with spirits 'is your gift (since you are describing it to someone in the dream who can't see what you see). Like some very connected psychics are helping police solving the mysterious disappearance/
deaths with the information they receive from the spirit world.
The fact that you physically feel this testify how you are the bridge between the worlds.

First I dreamt that I was on a bus with some friends and then some guys came on the bus smoking n stuff and passengers were bothered by it. I noticed the 'no smoking' sign was covered up or written over. The bus driver told us to leave the bus n I made a note of the license plate to report them.
After I dreamt I was at work n in a meeting with my boss and the engineer and my boss told me that my eyes look swollen. I told him it's prolly from not getting enough rest.
After it shifted to being in a hotel. But there was a door at the hotel with writing on it saying that nobody had the key to the door and therefore it remains locked - from management. I was with my friends n there was a narrow space under the door where I was able to see inside as the windows were tinted.
I saw the room looking like a lobby with some couches and decorations for both Halloween and Christmas. It looked sort of old fashioned. Then I saw a woman walking around. I called her to get her attention n she came.
I asked her to open the door so my friends n I can explore the rest of the hotel but she refused. Half of her body was able to fit under the door n she asked me to come closer. I told one of my friends to hold on to my legs in case anything happens. When I went closer, she grabbed me, trying to pull me across to the other side n then I woke up.

It was wild! Like something out of a horror movie.",2022-04-24 02:36:00,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

If its from early trauma it is trying to come out (which allows it to heal). The conscious mind suppresses pain. The unconscious mind wants to get rid of it. But in order to fool the conscious mind (because the conscious mind is the censor) the subconscious uses symbols to disguise your pain in dreams in order to be released. Therapy helps alot of people heal. Try posting some of the dreams. You might find insight in the interpretations

I was in a car with a friend and we were giving directions to a stranger. He managed to get out of the car as it slowed. I was not so lucky. He had a phone in the car and I was trying to call my dad to let him know where I was. It turned out that the phone did not work. That's when I said to the stranger I'm in trouble aren't I. He said yes. I said what are your plans. He said I'm going to do some killing tonight(meaning
me). In that instant I saw myself in pain and being burried. I tried to get out of the car at high speed, but he then stabbed me with a meat hook and I was being dragged along side the car by the hook in my thigh.
Somehow I got loose and fell into a body of water with aggressive polour bears that went to eat me.
I woke up yelling with blood on my knuckles. I had probably hit the bedside table. Not a fun way to spend my time asleep. I was haunted by this throughout the day feeling exhausted and shacky.",2022-04-17 15:04:01

If its from early trauma it is trying to come out (which allows it to heal). The conscious mind suppresses pain. The unconscious mind wants to get rid of it.

You felt trapped and not able to communicate with those who might help you (father). I do believe this dream is about putting that trauma or old self to rest. The driver is you. The killer is you. You want to end the old self because it feels too painful. On top of that you may have fear at expressing the emotions you feel concerning all this (the water). In the dream to express yourself means to be attacked again. So you swallowed it all.,2022-04-17 15:04:02

Lifestyle changes such as getting good exercise daily, meditation, resetting your circadian rhythm by getting outside to view unfiltered sunlight within an hour of waking and avoiding bright lights and screen use in the evenings, avoiding caffeine and eating late at night can be helpful for more restful sleep. Journaling, cognitive behavioral therapy and having a support network you can rely on can also be helpful in reducing anxious and fearful emotions that is fodder for nightmares.",2022-04-24 15:04:00,,,,,,

No other girls came along after school and I just got caught up in life. It’s not until far more recently, say the last 5 years or so that I’ve started to realise that I don’t really get the same feelings for guys anymore. I love my husband so I put that down to having found the guy I want which I know is true and I’m happy about that.

You are transforming in life right now. Death in a dream symbolizes change. This dream could be saying that the old you is passing away and a more peaceful version of yourself is emerging.

Water would typically represent the unconscious and/or emotions.

Interesting that the tidal wave was not destructive.

This morning i had a #horrible dream.
I was the prisoner of a man. I seemed to be kept in his big, rich house. I don't remember how i got there, but i guess i was kidnapped.
Although i didn't actually see it in the dream i know he tortured & raped me.
He totally controlled my life. Even deciding when/if i could eat.
I wasn't so bother about the rape...obviously i didn't want to have sex with him but i could cope with that. It was the physical violence/torture that made being there terrifying.
I knew it was best to go along with whatever he did or he'd do something worse to me, but some things scared me more than others. I was scared of pain, but i was also scared of drowning & anything that could suffocate me. {I should mention that in real-life i'm scared of those things}
In the dream their was 1 time i knew he was about to do something terrible to me. He handed me a scrunched up cloth rag & told me to put it in my mouth. It scared me because i didn't know why he wanted me to do it, but i put it in my mouth. I put it in the front of my mouth, so my mouth was open. Then he said ""no, put it further in & close your mouth."" I pushed the cloth further in a tiny bit & closed my lips over it. I'm sure he knew i was avoiding having the cloth further back in my mouth because i was scared of choking.
By this time i'd been with him months at the very least, so he'd know what scared me the most.
He told me to open my mouth, then with 1 finger he poked the cloth further in my mouth. I felt the cloth partly cover the back of my mouth, so i was instantly scared of choking or suffocating. Then i saw him pick up a reel of Duct tape. I knew he was going to tape my mouth closed...with the cloth in my mouth.
I coughed out the cloth & began begging him not to have the cloth in my mouth. I was crying hysterically. I asked him what he was going to do to me...he said ""you'll find out"".
I pleaded with him not to put the cloth in my mouth [or the tape over my mouth] because i might choke/suffocate. His emotionless response was ""well if you keep crying your nose will block & then you will suffocate. So stop crying & do what i say.""
Of course that made my fear even worse. So i put my hands together in a praying position & pleaded with him. I said ""I'll do whatever you want, but please don't kill me like this.""
He said ""I don't want to kill you. I don't want to lose my slave. I'm just doing this to keep you quiet"".
I was relieved he didn't intend to suffocate/choke me...although i wasn't sure he was telling the truth...but i was obviously terrified what he was going to do to me that what make me scream.
He said ""you know if you don't do what i say you'll make things worse for yourself."" But i was so desperate i carried on begging him. Then he suddenly grabbed me & held me infront of him...so i was stood infront of him, facing away from him. He held my arms down & was about to put the cloth in my mouth. I couldn't break free from him so in a panic i blurted out ""i'm pregnant"". I didn't for a second think he'd care about a baby, but i was willing to say anything to stop him. [I don't think i was pregnant but i don't know]
He froze & said ""what?""...I said ""I'm pregnant. So anything you do to me will hurt your baby"". He let go of me & i turned around to face him. He asked me when i found out. I said yesterday. He seemed shocked & asked why didn't i tell him. I said i thought you wouldn't care & you might kill our baby. He said he wouldn't do that to his own baby.
He said that me being pregnant changed everything & that he wasn't going to hurt me. I was confused that he could be so cruel to me, but care for his unborn baby.
He sat me down at his kitchen table [we'd been in the kitchen this whole time] & gave me a plate of food to eat. I thanked him & started wolfing down the food because i was so hungry. [that's because he usually only fed me enough to keep me going]
He said there's no need for me to eat it like that. He said he was sorry & he was going to look after me from now on.

👩‍👦I should mention that in this dream there was a little boy...I guess about 2 years old...who was often with me in the man's house. I know he wasn't my child, but often came to me instead of the man. For some weird reason that little boy was sometimes a #cat! So he could go in & out the man's house when he was a cat.

🐱The last time i dreamt of a cat was April 17th...that was of my passed cat Simba.

In the dream, I felt a bit of anxiety, thinking I've never seen such darck clouds ever before. As I looked out the window, I could see a cowboy hearding a beautiful black horse out of the storm's way. The rider looked worryed and he was pushing his horse as hard as he could to get out of the way, but the storm was catching up with him. It felt like he was trying to protect the stallion ahead of him (which looked quite small in comparison). Inside the house, my partner was holding onto a piece of furniture as the house started to shake as the storm was coming closer.
Can you give me a clue, please? I looked into it and found pieces of information that I cannot out together to form a coherent idea.

I’m freaking out because I’m thinking how much strength did they have to have to pull this little red headed girl through and drain, and how messed up her body was look now! (This whole time I was crying.) So I tell everyone in the house that someone is going through the drains and trying to steal people or anything they can grab. So I get advised by someone to go tell my father which is at my neighbors franks, as I’m telling him what’s happening, the across the street neighbor truck starts going off as if someone’s breaking in. (I want to add some better description of how close we live , imagine a square and it’s three houses but my house has two acres so it would take up the room for the forth house to have our houses right across the street from each other’s) so my dad and frank look at each other and say that’s probably him and after they say that the older guy right across the street with his truck broken into step out his door and screams. “HES HEADED YALLS WAY” so the person who broke in was a mid sized,black male. But I remembered seeing a white hand through the drain. So sense we live so close I tried to run to my house for safety and it was too late, my dad pull out his Glock the guy pulled out his gun and two shots were fired and I just shut my eye and I seen white, and it was like as if I felt the bullets as well but I just kept walking towards my house. I didn’t even look to see who had died I just went back to my room crying to my mom and my boyfriend and as I’m on the floor like hysterically crying I stand up and through the window I see the black male wrapped up (dead) and being put into like a police van. I distinctly remember after I seen his dead body in my head I went “I just seen a dead body”. I went into more of a shock and then more of a hysterical cry, and I remember my mom trying to get my grandma to come out and to calm me down, she gets to my house I head outside, and the last part before I woke I just remember sinking into her arms while falling on the prettiest, greenest grass I’ve ever seen.",2022-04-22 23:39:59,0.000000,1,0,1404029820118672,https://facebook.com/1404029820118672,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"This is a pretty complex dream, Im nit sure I have any solid ideas; but it does seem to relate to being influenced by outside forces (those taking people through the drain) snd being intruded upon, feeling threatened and conflict.

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?"").

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

It was dark & rainy in the garden & every time the dog was bringing one out I was bringing one back in trying to save them but hiding so I wasn’t seen. I was going back & forth when I realised one of the puppies were drowning in a paddling pool that was filling fast with the rain, I tried to save the puppy but I couldn’t, the aggressive dog wouldn’t stop barking at me & biting at my clothes but I was just crying holding this dead pup in the rain.

She said “it was weird bc he told me he died, he didn’t tell me how. My soul knew he was dead, but it was almost like he was more like a time traveler. I knew exactly what he looked like bc he would show himself, he appeared in human form and he couldn’t remember how to go back to his ghost form. He felt real, the dream felt real, and weirdly it felt like we had a soul connection. It was like I had known him for years but I had just met him.”

I’m curious if anyone can help me figure this out for her? I have tried looking up the meaning but can’t really find anything on it. I personally do not think it was a succubus, but I really don’t know how to interpret it to help her make sense of it.",2022-04-23 05:23:57,1.000000,1,0,1404026793452308,https://facebook.com/1404026793452308,780839497,Timothy Kippo,"Only she can really understand it when the pieces click, but you might be able to help give clues she is overlooking with an outsiders perspective.

For starters the sex is quite possibly not even about sex at all. In fact I'd argue this is an Animus dream using sex as a symbol of integration. That male I suspect represents masculine aspects of her own psyche she rejected in the past and ""killed off"" from her persona (hence ghost of her past) that she is now reconnecting with and accepting. There is a soul connection there because it is the Animus ie a part of her soul.",2022-04-24 15:05:14,,,,,,

By 'matchmaker' I mean that you were suggesting and approving these two souls to have some sort of adventure together here on earth. You knew the female soul well because she is part of your tribe. Does that make any sense?,2022-04-24 15:05:26,,,,,,

The other day I heard my kids voice say “mom,mom” and I woke up and yelled “WHAT?” 😂 then a few months back I was woken up by a male screaming voice in my head saying “are you sober”. I have prob had this happen about 10 times in my life with the first time being in like 2015 when I thought I heard my name in the living room after waking up. I have woken up to seeing shadows in the room also. Last time was about 4 months ago, there was a shadow of a man sitting at the dining table. It didn’t scare me though didn’t seem to be a real thing, I was also veryyy sleep deprived then. My sleep doctor said it sounds like hypnagogic hillucinations.",2022-04-24 15:05:27,,,,,,

Broke my heart....I woke him up and we talked - but he wouldnt' come into the house -\-\ walked away. Very upsetting.

I work with energy healing and so I did a session on my self and found a curse that was placed by a previous female acquaintance. I immediately released the curse but was so shocked by this but was so grateful for the warning.

I released the curse with prayer and started placing a shield around me more often.

It's very interesting yet there is no cure. I have it and the sounds can be very scary.

One year I was watching our shops outdoor table and standing on the edge of the nature strip. I could hear a faint child's voice calling me but I could not see anyone calling. Mind you it's a Saturday morning peak hour shoppers walking past. Her voice got more desperate. So I thought just walk towards where it sounds like it's coming from. I took 4 steps next minute a 4wd mounts the curve exactly where I was standing. My boss and team members all come running out thinking I had been hit and squashed. I still to this day believe in guardian angels.,2021-09-08 15:05:37,,,,,,

I was always told not to answer because you never know who it is. One day it woke me up for work when I otherwise would’ve been late. But I also heard my sons voice one night when he was right beside me and I immediately knew that it was something evil trying to deceive me. I was half asleep and told it to shut up… bad idea! It got angry and I heard footsteps running and it still used my son’s voice to scream at me. The next night I said a prayer out loud and also said that anything negative isn’t welcome in my home or near my children whatsoever.

I had a dream about her and I just want some thoughts and opinions…

In the dream, I walked into a room (I’d never been to this house nor seen it) and saw her hanging out with some of our other friends. She had already passed and was a ghost. I laid down beside her and caressed her face. I said, “I’m so happy to see you *****.” She said, “I’m not *****, I’m *****.” But I just can’t remember the name she said.

That gave me weird vibes but I just went with it. She asked me to go into the bathroom with her and I did. She started trying to put her fingers into my mouth and literally tear it open. Then she started trying to put her mouth on mine, violently.

We seemed to teleport from the bathroom to a car that she was is control of and wrecked. Then we seemed to teleport back to the house. I saw few people talking. It was said that, “The doll she gave her was an investigator.” I was hiding. She didn’t see me at first and I was trying to leave before she did. I made it outside but she saw me on the porch. She was trying to full on attack and a few other ghosts of people I knew were helping but I can’t remember who they were now.

I kept repeating, “I banish thee!” Over and over until I woke up.

She was opening your mouth violently because she was herself struggling to express herself. As I see this, she probably thought about some of the people she could call during her final moments. As you have said the accident was bad, perhaps she had some moments of fear. Perhaps the images that reached you triggered some fear and she was struggling to get through.

Either way, her being with a group should indicate she's not alone and helpless as she might have felt. It's in my book a beautiful sign as well and perhaps she just came over to say hi and the rest of it was you both having a conversation in which you were trying to tell her how deeply hurt you are, and perhaps she was trying to tell you that she was ready to move on..",2022-04-24 15:06:32,,,,,,

The man could be some external influence (eg another person or form of media) or some unconscious internal process.

The tiger has a lot of potential connotations, eg powerful feminune sexuality, or some kind of duality (stripes).

Certainly not a definitive interpretation but hopefully a starting point.",2022-04-17 15:06:41,,,,,,

Tiger however ""doesn't change it's stripes"" so this imagery might be contradictory..
.

It reminds me of the phrase ""plus ca change, plus ca reste le meme""= the more things change the more they stay the same

It might be that you are or someone you know is encouraging you to develop a new aspect of yourself, but that this new aspect of you would be similar to how you have been before in life.

It is also interesting that the man is trying to impregnate you using the tiger, when the logical thing would be for a man to try himself - sex can sometimesbe about growing closer to someone, but it can also symbolize integration.

Is there any example in life right now of trying to connect with a part of yourself or in a relationship with another person where it feels impractical, experimental, awkward or unnatural?

Tiger is also a wild animal, it can be about embracing your animal instincts, as Timothy says above perhaps female sexuality. It might be that someone you know, likely male, is encouraging you to connect with this part of yourself.

Maybe that a closeness with someone else is surprisingly turning into an opportunity to connect with part of yourself.",2022-04-17 15:06:41,1401937850327869,https://facebook.com/1401937850327869,30314326,Kelly Kelly,"Nina Kaye Thanks.

Considering that I would match it with the following meaning of a tiger:
The tiger could represent your ambition, career, or studies. And the dream could be a reminder for you to work harder or maybe it's admonishing you to stop procrastinating
.

Sooo I think the dream means the following:

You are about to make big steps towards your goals, but for some reason you are doubtful. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that you wonder if you will be up for it.

I was standing Infront of my bathroom mirror with purple and blue hair. I’ve had these colours in my hair before but not currently. I remember preferring these colours for some reason but in waking life i prefer the pink.

I know it’s not very detailed but I’m just rather intrigued to see what it means.

Also, I wasn’t gonna mention this second dream. But, there was a girl I used to go to primary school with and once in a blue moon I have dreams about her. I don’t think about her in waking life and I haven’t spoken to her for several years. I just think it’s odd. If you want the details of the dream from last night I was in a shopping isle with her and she was just sitting on the ground. I can’t remember the rest so it’s nothing to go off really. I’m just more intrigued as to why I dream about her?

How you view her and whether thats a topical issue at the time of the dream is a good starting point.

As for the hair, thats not easy really. Since it comes from the head it can relate to thought, but could also be about how you present/
organise yourself outwardly, lots of ways to look at hair.

Blue and purple, its hard not to look at chakras, especially licated around the head so might be about communication (blue) or intuition (purple); but again other associations you could delve into.",2022-04-24 15:06:53,1402644623590525,https://facebook.com/1402644623590525,100078462727492,Nękø Nightfall,Timothy Kippo thank you so much 😊,2022-04-24 15:06:54

I dreamt that I was in a seaside town somewhere. I was actually going to see someone. Someone who was popular on tv and was able to keep the magic of childhood alive for many people (still doing it today). I stopped outside a house which was next to a beach. It wasn’t a flashy beach house but it had a homey cosy look and feel to it. This man came out, and I asked for the person in question I was looking for, and I was told I was at the right place and to go in. There I met the person I was looking for. And he was actually really nice and friendly and chatty. He showed me around the house and he took me to one room, and I saw the most amazing collection of memorabilia of this tv childhood. And that w was when I woke up.

I want to add that I have met this person a couple of times in real life, and he is a great person and very friendly.

Also the dream had no sinister intentions.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/

unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

I hope you enjoy and get value from it. This is a group for people interested in dreams but we are generally not professionals or doing this for money, rather for entertainment/self exploration purposes only.

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Please also observe the following recommendations:

Please do not contact interpreters by PM unless they give you permission to do so.

A PM can only be requested by a dreamer - if you are asking Dreamer's to contact you, you will be removed from the group.

Do not use this group to self promote.

Please post more than just a single dream symbol (eg don't just say ""I dreamt of a white snake whats it mean?""). Share the whole dream.",2021-08-14 06:44:34,76.000000,25,0,1235650413623281,https://facebook.com/1235650413623281,100001027268137,Elisah Meis,"I personally would prefer is members would make it their standard to add the following information for a better, more personal explanation.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams.

Top weirdest or most intense dreams I have had before in my life that are hard to forget...

1. The Clown Birth and the Confetti Baby 👶 🎊 🤡
Sometime between my teens or early 20s, I had dreamt I was pregnant(I'm a cis straight male, fyi) and I was going to the hospital to deliver when the doctor showed up as a clown and all my wet nurses were oompa loompas. When I had delivered it was a baby made of confetti string and confetti paper.

2. Waking the Dragon 🐉 👮‍♂️ 🗡 ⚰
In the past 5-7 years I had this dream that I was attending a funeral of a fellow officer of the law like myself in the dream(I've never been a cop irl, but I was in military), when all mayham began suddenly and the sky was raining fire and brimstone everywhere. There was outside this sinkhole excavation in the middle of the black top road with slimy roots covered in mud and ice. Inside was also dragon skeleton in it that had come to life and regrew its flesh and scales when I charged into battle in a cop uniform and a sword, slaying it.

3. The Time Keep of Skeleton Keys and the Pegasus Flight 🔑 🏰🌥🐎
In the past year I had a dream that I was in this alt fantasy dimension or world where I was staying as a house guest to a farmer who let me stay for being an extra hand on his property. I had helped him bury what appeared to be both an animal and a son to this man when we left to go to his barn and inside was a trailer and his daughter who was calming an excited brownish redish Pegasus. She was a beautiful woman and her father made a comment about how she had a way with beasts. She and her friends invited me to tag along when we took that Pegasus and other mythical creatures out flying. I flew on the brownish redish pegasus. We had came across a castle/ citadel floating in the sky and landed. We searched the place which was empty and barren finding bags of magical skeleton keys that looked like normal keys and a note to me from a future me about a book I would one day write and how important it would be. We left flying away as the castle citadel was enveloped in a nasty thunderstorm behind us.

4. The Watery Overpass of Homeless Vets, a SeaLion with Lips wearing a Hoodie and the Subway Shelter in the Storm 🌪 🪖 📦 🧺 🛒 🦭
I had this dream roughly sometime in the past 3 years. I was walking like on a long distance hike 🚶‍♂️ and I came to rest in a highway overpass where there were homeless sleeping and people relaxing. There was a water way that came to the edge under the overpass where SeaLions relaxed catching their breath. One of these SeaLions had a brown zip up hoodie on and had lips like a human trying to catch his breath. A group of homeless vets surrounded me begging for help and trying to talk me into some kind of scheme. It gave me bad vibes so I got out of dodge and ran away. I came to a street market with vendor stalls set up everywhere on the side walks and along park area selling all kinds of goods from food to clothes and other specially hand made crafted goods. Suddenly a storm started out of nowhere and a tornado touched down. I took charge and led everyone to shelter in some kind of underground subway type of walking path where we all waited out the storm and I talked and soothed people into peace.

5. Interior Design, Psychic Spiritual Sermons, Hummingbird Friends and Acme Birds 🏡 🔮 🐦🥞
In the beginning of this dream, I was helping a pregnant couple plan their home and they wanted it so that their room and their child's room were connected by a doorway and wall like how some hotel rooms are constructed conjoined by a door in the middle of them. Later in the same dream I was outside a church like building where I gave a speech about spiritual topics and sat on a park bench explaining a divergence in timelines to a friend and stranger and how I offer psychic abilities to help people heal and grow in their own. A hummingbird flew up to my face in the dream at this time catching my attention then flying away just as another bird suddenly struck the ground like a rock as if gravity had been turned up really high really suddenly and very briefly when like a balloon this pancaked bird reinflated then flew away.

6. The Shadow Gorilla caged in the Grocer 🦍🏪🛒👨‍🔬🧪
This dream was sometime this past year when I had dreamt I was a scientist and had made a Grodd/Kong like Gorilla who absolutely hated me and wanted to destroy me. It chased me into a grocery store with an underground parking garage where I trapped it inside the grocery fleeing through the parking garage. My fellow associates showed up with a mind control device they built to sooth and calm the gorilla and asked me to use it but I was hesitant until I finally decided to try it but all I felt was this gorillas immense anger and hatred. I quickly took the device off and placed it down. I went and searched the vehicle and my associates purse for whatever reason looking for what I have no idea when out of the corner of my eye I noticed as my associates mindlessly chatted away the device was just sitting there as the gorilla got visually more and more angry and uncomfortable eventually blasting through the front wall and doors and I took off running. 🏃‍♂️

7. Mistress of Flame vs the Mistress of Ice and my City Night Life Lady Escapades. 🦸‍♀️🔥🏙👭
This dream was sometime between a year and two ago. I was a woman and I was a super hero with fire like abilities as well as empathetic telepathy. I was walking downtown with a male friend who was drunk that I was attempting to have get a cab home when a ball of fire fell from the sky landing in the lake new our downtown strip where we were walking. A woman walked out of the water covered in ice asking if she was seen when I told her that at least a half dozen cameras had seen her. She told me it was a shame to kill me then as she began hurling ice sickles at me that I blew up with fireballs. This continued for a while as she drew closer and closer to me while exchanging words when suddenly we locked arms and embraced making out with one another against a chain link fence.

8. Me Kissing Me in the Dark 🪞 💋 👫💏 🚪
I had this dream sometime in the past few months, where I was home alone on my computer looking up things. I sent my dog who I don't own or know into the kitchen and other room. There was a shuffling noise at my front door like someone messing with the handle. I went to open and see who was there when suddenly as I opened a women in shadows burst through grappling and embracing me pushing me into the room. We landed on the edge of my bed with her on top of me when I blurted out asking who she was was when she replied, ""you"" then began kissing me passionately.",2022-04-21 09:29:30,0.000000,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The car was white with black specks all over it. We arrived at the place and my aunt was there. We let one friend out and we went to park and once we did I got out of the car and couldn’t see because the sun was so bright. I went back for my sunglasses but my friend and my car was gone. I woke up briefly and fell back asleep only to continue the dream. I tried to make it over to my aunt but the place changed and I was wearing some type of mask and couldn’t see well. I also heard some strange music. At some point I had a different phone that I knew wasn’t mine and I didn’t know how to use it.

I remember I walked up to him and we talked and I remember laying my head on his shoulder and just being so happy. We were like on rocks or something. Colorado? It was weird. Anyways this giant bolder started to fall and then the ground under us started to break and we started falling. He reached his hand out to me as we were falling and said, “what are you doing in 59 years?” (Weird, I know). Anyways I was never able to reach him and then I remembered my son. My son wasn’t with me and I started freaking out and then I woke up.

The time was 2:08PM. We saw red lights flashing at the railroad crossing. Dad stopped at the railroad crossing and waited for the train. We looked left and right to see if the freight train was approaching. Dad thought about going through. He did a U-Turn and went a different direction to the doctors office. We arrived at the doctors office. Dad walked ahead of me upstairs to the doctors office. I lost sight of him. I ran up the first flight of stairs then I heard footsteps thinking it was my dad walking up the steps but it was someone else. When I was about halfway up the steps I heard them announce my name on the Public Announcement System. I reached the 3rd floor where the doctors office was located I saw old clients sitting in their chairs then I woke up.

Can anyone help interpret this dream?",2022-04-20 18:59:56,1.000000,1,0,1402324220289232,https://facebook.com/1402324220289232,100001145077388,Joëlle Klemer,"You might be on autopilot atm.
What I mean is you think logic and avoid thinking emotionally.

The train that isn’t coming is kinda of the expression “missing the train” but it isn’t quite it.
You “don’t see a train”.
You are waiting at flashing light so there is a sense of emergency/
danger ahead.
You do a u-turn.

It can be seen as “forget Plan A, let’s take plan B”.
(Change of directory instead of waiting… acting upon).

Going upstairs is seen as “improving your life”.
You dad is ahead of you.
Maybe you need guidance a little bit.

Doctors appointment is to “fix something with you.”

Fixing something maybe you aren’t feeling your top self and you aren’t sure how to fix it.

People being old could be wisdom or vulnerability.
As you reach a state where you feel you need more wisdom or you feel dependant/
vulnerable.

2:08 can be “infinite duality.”

Trust in a relationship is very important, and it is better to have high standards about this - to have someone who is consistently open, honest, and shows care and commitment. It is something you want to feel certainty about if you plan to both invest in a shared life together. If you are finding that uncertainty, hold to a high standard, request that commitment, transparency, assurance, knowing it is better to be alone if that is what you need to do",2022-04-17 15:07:29,,,,,,

I can send papers about it if you'd like, but the steps are something like this:

1. Write down the dream narrative as it is
2. Write down a NEW version of the dream narrative that would turn the dream into a non-nightmare (for example, walking through the ring of fire, not being burnt, or maybe getting a hug from Hades, I don't know).
3. Practice ""rehearsing"" the dream in its *modified* version.
4. Supposedly this rehearsal will train the brain to modify the experience of the nightmare when it is dreamt.

To be clear I have never done this myself but the literature has shown promising results (has anyone here had success with this technique?).

Becoming lucid during the nightmare would be another strategy (I have done this and had success). If he's never lucid dreamt before it may take a bit of work, but becoming lucid and taking control of the dream would be one path.

However, I think these strategies both address the symptoms, and not the root cause. I tend to agree with Alexandra that processing the underlying emotions would be the way to truly resolve the problem, but these strategies may provide some relief if the nightmares are becoming an issue on their own.",2022-04-17 15:07:34,,,,,,

When I woke up I remembered the beginning of the dream, now I do not but I remember it was simple and insignificant and I didn't remember or understand how the dream ended up the way it did.
Something happened and I realized I was living in some kind of simulation. All I can remember is looking through different simulations, it seemed like I was almost being dropped in each one but could continue through to another as I pleased. I can't remember any specific details about these places aside from I was normally dropped outside, it was only 4-5, and they were all different. I can remember someone very clearly saying ""you can't keep doing this to us"" and I can't remember exactly who it was, whether it was a person in one of the simulations or someone that was with me, but it feels like it was someone traveling with me. It was most likely a male that sounded distressed.

It wasn't a lot of it though. I go to the person behind the counter and ask do know how to report domestic abuse? He didn't answer. I then go outside and there is a man who starts talking to me. I didn't want to talk I just asked if he knew how to report domestic abuse. Again no answer.

My dad committed suicide 12 years ago, I was 11 at the time. I had a tough time dealing with it for many years, but I’ve been working on letting go and move on for about 3 years.
The dreams are very different, but it’s always the same pattern: my dad comes back for a day, week, month, and he totally ignores me. I try to talk to him but he just pushed me away and talk to everyone else. Then when it’s time for him to go back to “heaven” (I’m not a religious person), he tells me he loves me and misses me, and that I have to move on. And then I scream and cry and wake up crying.
Last night I dreamt that he was back, I was a kid again, and all my family was together looking for a house and trying to start “a new life”, everything was the way it was before he died. All my family, brother, mom, dad, grandpa and grandpa, aunts etc was sitting around a table, eating dinner. Then I “woke up”, and I was all alone by the table. So I woke up from a dream, in my dream. And I started crying and looking for my family, and I said over and over “it’s too much, I can’t take this anymore”, and then I woke up crying.

I think you are dreaming of your dad more and more because while the feeling of loss was raw and unprocessed, all you felt was the grief of his loss, and the palpable absence of this person.

You felt ""he is gone! He is not here!"" And the pain of that was first and foremost.

Now that you are processing the grief, you are moving back to the feeling of his presence, and the joy and comfort that you felt being together with him, the love he had for you.

You always had the joy, love and comfort there too, underneath the pain of loss, but couldn't access it.

Now you can open and access this joy again, because the grief is not making you turn away from the happiness that is there.

Of course this is a scary process - opening to feeling comfort, joy, love, security, happiness, this is a reminder of how that good feeling is something that can be taken away. Which is frightening. And causes inner conflict ""maybe I shouldn't feel the joy, because then it will hurt more if I lose that feeling""

The dream is telling you, ""you never lost that feeling, it has always been there and it always will be there. The joy is bigger than the grief. The pain turned you away from the joy, the joy never left""

It is saying that your father, in this way, and also in how you are very much like him in many good ways, your father has never left you.

Instead of feeling his absence, you are feeling his presence, as you open up to the positive attachment you felt with him, and as you open up to the side of yourself that is very much like your father.

In the dreams, the contrast of being alone and being with family is a reminder that you are never truly alone when you have loved and been loved. For all those you connect with in life, you live in their hearts, as they live in yours. In this way, there is a life beyond death, time, and place.

But I have epilepsy, which makes me forget things, especially things in the past. So I guess I’m also very scared of losing those memories and him. He is always with me, I know that, but just feeling his spiritual presence isn’t enough for me if I don’t even remember our time together.. all I have now is small memories, pictures and my mother who helps me remember. But me and my dad had our own “thing”, we were very close and I just feel like I’m losing him in another way. It’s affecting my dreams and sleep, causing stress and sadness which then affects my epilepsy. And I don’t know how to control my dreams or my feelings..",2022-04-17 15:07:49

My dad committed suicide 12 years ago, I was 11 at the time. I had a tough time dealing with it for many years, but I’ve been working on letting go and move on for about 3 years.
The dreams are very different, but it’s always the same pattern: my dad comes back for a day, week, month, and he totally ignores me. I try to talk to him but he just pushed me away and talk to everyone else. Then when it’s time for him to go back to “heaven” (I’m not a religious person), he tells me he loves me and misses me, and that I have to move on. And then I scream and cry and wake up crying.
Last night I dreamt that he was back, I was a kid again, and all my family was together looking for a house and trying to start “a new life”, everything was the way it was before he died. All my family, brother, mom, dad, grandpa and grandpa, aunts etc was sitting around a table, eating dinner. Then I “woke up”, and I was all alone by the table. So I woke up from a dream, in my dream.

I can't remember specifically how it started, but there was a male individual that was ousted from my family for something he didn't do. Rather than siding with my family on this one I believed in him as I knew he could never have done what he was being accused of.

At some point, things escalated where my family was planning to chase him away, so the both of us left.

We ended up splitting when we left and I somehow ended up in my dad's apartment. No one was present but his wife, and there was a Golden Retriever there. He was filthy, and as I tried to hose him down I could see all the dirt and grime coming off of him. I thought there was no way I could let him stay there.

Well, I happened to look around and also saw there was a baby, and the baby needed it's diaper changed. That's when my dads wife came in and I became angry, telling her I was going to take the baby as it was obvious she was unfit to take care of her. She was pretty calm during the whole interaction but tried to take her baby back, but eventually relented and went back to her room while I changed the baby.

By the end of it all, I realized that I was just overreacting. At least, in terms of the baby, as it wasn't like she had been crying and put two and two together and figured the baby had probably just made a mess and it wasn't his wife's fault. However, there was definitely no excusing the neglected dog.

I went into her room with the baby and apologized, telling her I knew she was a good mom and that I was sorry for attempting to take her baby, that I knew she would never forgive me if I had taken her.

His wife told me it was alright, that the reason why she didn't fight so hard is because she knew I would make the right decision. She then told me, for whatever reason, that if I wanted from now on I could come and fold her laundry and she's pay me $1.75 every time I did her laundry. I told her no thanks and was planning to leave with the dog, but then I woke up.

I woke up feeling very sad and guilty. I don't normally remember dreams, but this one stuck with me and I couldn't really find anything online about what it could mean.",2022-04-20 09:47:35,1.000000,1,0,1401800630341591,https://facebook.com/1401800630341591,100009042510759,Roy De Ruyter,This is about you evolving and taking a stand for yourself in life. Standing up for the male individual was you speaking up for yourself. Taking a stand in life. You speak your peace about the baby but realize that you may have pushed it a bit too much. It's because you are learning about loyalty and how it fits or works in your life. That is why you are cleaning the dog off. This represents your loyalty because dogs are very loyal. You are learning the value of being loyal and becoming loyal to the truth. That is what I see with this dream.,2022-04-17 15:07:54,,,,,,

I was in a car with a friend and we were giving directions to a stranger. He managed to get out of the car as it slowed. I was not so lucky. He had a phone in the car and I was trying to call my dad to let him know where I was. It turned out that the phone did not work. That's when I said to the stranger I'm in trouble aren't I? He said yes. I said what are your plans. He said I'm going to do some killing tonight(meaning me). In that instant I saw myself in pain and being burried. I tried to get out of the car at high speed, but he then stabbed me with a meat hook and I was being dragged along side the car by the hook in my thigh.
Somehow I got loose and fell into a body of water with aggressive polour bears that went to eat me.

Things like:

How did the dream make you feel?
(Happy,scared, annoyed, angry etc.)

In what scenery did the dream take place?
(Beach, woods, living room, on the streets etc.)

Mention special, outstanding details
(the color of a car, if the room had windows/doors or not, did the person have a face etc.)

Do u remember having a semi similar dream before? If so, when was it? & could you describe it, or at least mention any similarities you still remember. If you had more then 2 similar dreams, please list their similarities. Like they all had blue cars, or big fishes in them.
(This will indicate if this is a topic that has occupied the dreamer for a longer time. Especially if the dreamer has had multiple dreams with big fish in them, in combination with how the dreams made them feel, is very telling!!!)

I am probably forgetting alot more, however at this moment i think this would be my last request:

A little bit of their back story/current life situation.
(Like in a relationship/
single, religious or not, going to school/working/
unemployed, kids/pets or not, etc. If they dont want to disclose i completely understand however it is very significant for dreams. Like if you dream you are getting married but in fact dont even have a partner, its very different from when you do. Same goes for kids, dream of giving birth when in fact you arent pregnant nor have you ever been, is very different from someone who had 3 kids with a fourth on its way. And if you dream about being or going to school alot, but you haven't been in school for over 20 years, it means something completely different then for someone who is just starting collage... well i think u catch my drift... )

(HOWEVER i need to add one more thing in regards to religion.... put thats more of an opinion then anything else.... to each his own& i honestly respect everyones beliefs, religion & traditions... However it does bother me sometimes that some members plant seeds of panic, in an already panicked member by saying demons are coming for them and they need to pray. Stuff like that.... like, in what way is that a dream explanation?? If they would atleast explain why they state these things... but no. Without any explanation they post under many nightmare posts, to pray, go to church, call the priest, burn sage etc. Like yo i am willing to do all for you, ill ask the pope himself to cleanse your home if it was demon invested... but yooo these ""demons"" in your dreams, arent real demons, they are symbolic for something, like struggling with your inner demons...
Ok so i needed to get this off my chest, because this is just installing unnecessary fear in people. And it has nothing to do with the actual meaning of a dream.... Dreams contain real important messages for what happends within for us to be unraveled, we dont need prayers but serious dream volunteers to unraffle them. )

(We need priests, prayers, sage, lucky charms & the police or ghost busters to protect us. Lets give them a break and not involve them in dream descriptions.)",2021-09-08 15:08:21,,,,,,

Our interpreters (anyone can interpret) are volunteers and not paid or dedicated to spending all their time here, so please treat them with respect even if what they say doesn't resonate - likewise when interpreting it helps to frame the interpretation as your opinion as opposed to instructing on what the dream means.

If you don't receive a response it is nothing personal, just bad timing. You can post a comment to bump your dream to the top of the feed. I have asked Facebook for a no response filter but so far that hasn't happened, would make things a lot easier!

Chicken - to be afraid of something, or to not back down because of fear ""dont chicken out""

Katsi Phillips

""Running around like a chicken with it's head cut off"" - to rush around frantically without thinking -In a frenzied manner, distractedly, crazily

""Bare bones of a situation""- for the basic unadorned facts to be revealed, just the essentials

Dream-

I was with my nana but I never seen her, I just knew it was her and heard her voice, she drove me home from work then I was home (in her house I am NEVER in my own apartment in every dream I remember I am never in my own place) and was making a thing I saw on tiktok where u use sharpie and make little designs and the water makes the design float, you will usually do this in a sink, but I was doing it in a plastic bag and wanted to make like a fish bowl but was failing (lol) the water turned dirty so I went outside on the front deck to drain off the railing. While I did that I hear this noise like a really fast car?, small Toy car? Noise zoom down the street and these two men? Boys? Teens like my age I believe couldn’t catch it so stopped under the street light, it was dusk,they caught eye of me and I did a quick smile and continued on with what I was doing thinking nothing of it. One of the boys wore all black and a hood, he just stood there very thin. But the other dude wicked tall, thin thin, very pale, reddish, light orange hair cut real short started running right at me jumped up the steps real fast and grabbed me, kept grabbing me on my side and trying to take me or hurt me his face was serious like I wasn’t supposed to see what happened and I honestly thought nothing of it. I started screaming because it really scared me and my nana voice was heard loud “HEYYY!!!” And the dude got startled let go of me put his hands up and said “I wasn’t gonna I didn’t” and before he could fished I shoved him as soon as my hands touched him I woke up.

- End dream

Heart racing, legs go numb, chills all over I lay there catching my breath holding my dog and I ￼ instantly had the thought he was an angel. I rolled over on my side, it was super windy out as we had a storm last night, after a few mins of me laying there thinking I head a huge crack (like a tree fell) scared me and I jumped up and looked out my windows before running to the kitchen. Finding a 50+ year old tree had just given up and broke the fence, etc of my yard.
I don’t get scared of noises often but I have very bad ptsd from storms, although I love a thunderstorm.

I’m wondering if this can be a coincidence? Was the “angel”￼ really an angel, why when he heard my nana voice he got scared? Why did he want to hurt me? Why wasn’t my dog there? I always have my dog with me. Why did I never see my nana at all but knew she was there? So many questions, so many possibilities.

I’m now startled to go out front with out someone with me, even with my dog. I feel so dumb, I don’t get scared of people. Even if I am scared I hold my ground. My legs always go numb, shake and feel weak when I’m scared so it’s a feeling that’s not new to me.",2022-04-20 04:36:08,0.000000,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

One moment, I was back in high school classrooms, taking notes on my computer and missing lectures and assignments. The next, I was on the school's backlot watching as Sandman from Spider-Man somehow infused his sand with Peter Parker's friends, causing them to melt. Spidey then showed up and invented a a spray that reversed the effects and restore his friends. From the people who came back, I joined them and we established a village. However, a physical fight with someone caused me to get amnesia. A gal pal from college then appeared wearing a bikini and I didn't recognize her, but was intrigued by her Crush soda drink -\-\ I don't remember exactly what I said, but it was something along the lines of ""It's funny you're drinking that cuz you're my crush"".

To say ""i am like my mom"" to try to stop the lion attack can be that the answer to this issue is to draw clear outline in the new relationship that if this new partner is interested in being with you, that your daughter is too young and dependent to be separated from you, that she has to be considered and protected in any choice that you make.

You might also feel nervous yourself that having a new relationship it might feel like prioritizing yourself instead of protecting her and protecting yourself (because a new relationship as great and beneficial as it is can also introduce fears too)

It might feel like taking this new journey with a relationship that you might feel concerned that it might lead you to overlook her wellbeing

Anytime someone new comes into one's life we have to rejuggle priorities. In this case, how to make room for a new person while still prioritizing your daughter

Draw the boundaries, letting this new person know that whatever they mean to you, your daughter comes first.

And the normal fears in any new relationship about how you might get your own heart broken if it doesn't end well, this is exacerbated by feeling that your daughter is also vulnerable here.

Because she is dependent on you, your wellbeing and hers is linked.

Try to broach these issues in the relationship, try to do it neutrally as possible, and notice this person's reaction.

If they open up, show empathy, reassurance, allow things to progress slowly. Then this is a good response.

If they have intensity, jealousy, dismissive, or insistence/
pushiness, this is a sign of not respecting your boundaries, emotional needs, and values.

That's just a general idea, just take a look at how things go if telling them fears and concerns",2022-04-17 15:09:04

I have had a lot of life changes in the past 3 months (new relationship after being single for years, new job, currently in the middle of moving out of my sisters house and on my own again) and I have anxiety which I'm not currently treating with medication, so I'm aware that a lot of this might be anxiety related as I've had 2 pretty severe panic attacks from this dream, but I was hoping for some outsiders opinions and maybe some tips on how to stop hyper fixating on the dream.

Lion - pride, family, courage or cowardice, mastering wild instinct, territory

Lionness - provider, mothering, fierce protector of children

To dream of being attacked by a lion is feeling victimized by these things

emotional nourishment.

Unknown woman ""with bun in the oven"" is the woman you are going to turn into, because you are working on developing a new self, a rebirth.

You are not sure yet how to develop this change or what you will be like.

Lessons from your granddad about comfort and emotional nourishment is guiding you how to reinvent yourself.

Like the furniture and the drawers were full of jewellery and ornaments which felt like they were the previous owner's and there were antique dressers and cupboards etc. All full of treasures I felt I wanted to keep as I was discovering them for the first time and I did not want to clear any of them out! Many of the dreams about houses are of the similar frequency in details.....always the house is old, there are many rooms and I keep looking for more, small or big and I sometimes find new items. Sometimes the dream is black and white but this mornings dream was in colour as the jewellery was colourful. Especially a ring I found, as I held it I dropped it and had to bend down to look for it. I found it and specifically it was a round band, half in baguette cut emeralds.

This is my second post on this page and both responses have been rather accurate! I have always valued life lessons more than material things and nature holds much more value than objects to me so I love the possibility that I could be an old soul. I am also on a learning journey and discovering new personal limits. I recently left a job that taught me how to become much stronger as a woman than what I ever imagined was achievable! Recently I have been meditating in a small group which throws up all sorts of interesting visions and sensations. Do you think it may be linked to wanting to turn to setting up my own reflexology treatment room? Recently I have had opportunities that I haven't accepted, mainly due to a lack of confidence. Spiritually, I am moving towards a stronger faith and in a sense fighting to let go of my old self I'm hoping that makes sense to you).",2022-04-17 15:09:11

Years ago after I split up with my son's father I started seeing a man named Earl. We had a really good time together. I really liked him. He had problems though and he drank way too much. He would get sloppy drunk almost every day. So I had to break it off with him. I didn't want to but I couldn't help him and at the time I had a 3 year old to care for that didn't need to be around a falling down drunk. It broke his heart when I ended things.

One evening my son and I were at a friend's house when he showed up crying drunk still begging me. I was annoyed so I grabbed my son and we went home and went to bed.

I finally found him and he was just standing there smiling at me. I ran up to him and told him I was sorry about the loss of his brother and he didn't say a word he just kept smiling. I went to hug him and it was one of those really long hugs that you don't want to end. Then I woke up. About 10 mins after I woke his sister called me to inform me that he had passed away in the night. He overdosed. Am I crazy for thinking that really wasn't a dream?

It makes sense that you would want to go to him and hug him, as you had to fight your own desires to leave in the first place. His smile could simply be relief that you had sought him out after trying so hard to win you back.

On the other hand, I’ve met people with similar dreams, for lack of better term, that are really uncanny and hard to dismiss. I’ve had some myself... So while I can’t say it is, I wouldn’t tell you that it’s not, and you certainly aren’t crazy for considering all options.",2022-04-17 15:09:16,,,,,,

About 10 mins after I woke his sister called me to inform me that he had passed away in the night. He overdosed. Am I crazy for thinking that really wasn't a dream? I believe his soul was telling me goodbye. Does anyone have any thoughts or opinions on this occurrence? Please and thank you.,2022-04-17 02:43:01,,5,0,1401092900412364,https://facebook.com/1401092900412364,100000039783347,Jodi Lynn,He came to you in your dream. He was smiling and at peace.

Years ago after I split up with my son's father I started seeing a man named Earl. We had a really good time together. I really liked him. He had problems though and he drank way too much. He would get sloppy drunk almost every day. So I had to break it off with him. I didn't want to but I couldn't help him and at the time I had a 3 year old to care for that didn't need to be around a falling down drunk. It broke his heart when I ended things. He blew my phone up for over a week begging me for another chance. I stood my ground and kept telling him no. One evening my son and I were at a friend's house when he showed up crying drunk still begging me. I was annoyed so I grabbed my son and we went home and went to bed. That night I dreamt that his identical brother died. The dream was so vivid. I remember being really worried about Earl. I was looking everywhere for him to see if he was okay. I finally found him and he was just standing there smiling at me. I ran up to him and told him I was sorry about the loss of his brother and he didn't say a word he just kept smiling. I went to hug him and it was one of those really long hugs that you don't want to end. Then I woke up. About 10 mins after I woke his sister called me to inform me that he had passed away in the night. He overdosed. Am I crazy for thinking that really wasn't a dream?

Your higher self or guides will often use the lyrics of the song to remind you of something or impart msg..

First part looks like HS reassuring you of their presence /

If you need a friend
Don't look to a stranger
You know in the end
I'll always be there
And when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around
And I'll be there",2022-04-17 15:09:22

First I posted , the second by the time I woke up I couldn’t remember and the 3rd. I found $10,000 in the woods. But kept it hidden bc I was afraid the rightful owner would tell me I couldn’t keep it…….there was also a gun with the money 😂",2022-04-19 13:35:45,0.000000,1,0,1401165577071763,https://facebook.com/1401165577071763,100009042510759,Roy De Ruyter,The money represents some gain or wealth that you don't feel that you deserve.

First part of the Dream i found a baby. I cant remember anymore.
Next part - So This time i dreamt i was walking in an area covered in snow. Just behind where my grandma lives. I Saw a White thick scarf hanging from a tree the Day before so i went and took it. Then it was Dark and. I had to get my phone out to navogate back to my grandmas place as i dont go out in the Dark.
I Got “home” But it was not my grandmas House But a woman that took the baby as ot was hers. My cousin was small again and stsyed with her. She Said i could stay But she left bc i cheated on her. What? I begged her to Pls stay bc it was a 10 story building and it had codes to come in and i did not wanna be alone. There was then 10 ppl in the House then i left to look around and Saw a store on the roof. I went back Down and there was smoke in the whole appartment. My sister ans a friend of hers i Think was there and several ppl i did not know it was a smoke alarm. I remember i Got scared to know bc what if i dont hear it if it goes of at Night? Then everyone left and i followed. It was very chsothic. I asked how long they would he gone. They Said 5 days. Then the dream Cut of. Many mone things But This is riughly what happened.
