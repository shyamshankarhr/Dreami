I was talking to him then something he said made me ask him, “what did you do?” I remember feeling like he was talking about me, but he tried to hide it. Then I realized the apartment complex is in poor condition, inside the apartment looks like a messy hoarder situation, and then I noticed several feral cats.

The guy can be representing something you did (you asking him ""what did you do?"" ) and so the interior of the apartment is a reflection of how you feel about whatever that was. Hence you feel you are kind of a mess and the feral cats might be some cattiness that felt out of control or unlike you. Cats can also represent female sexuality, introversion or intuition among other things. The fact they are feral in the dream suggests you were judging yourself for not attending to them and letting your more animalistic urges run free. Basically, I think you woke up with anxiety because there was some situation in your life that you think you should have behaved differently but we are often our harshest critics so perhaps the dream is indicating to give yourself the compassion/ help you thought you should show the guy in the dream.

So basically, she’s telling you that goodbyes aren’t forever if you love someone, and to take advantages of opportunities while you can as ‘risks.’ By connecting logic with your subconscious, you are correct because you cannot just imagine something NEW or create something that you have not seen details of before.

Blue can also be related to throat chakra and communication skills. Walls can be about separation or what keeps others from getting close to you. Stone pebbles can represent strength. Creatively decorated can reference your skills so maybe you have a strength there. A thing for you to play in might be you are enjoying a playful attitude or having time for play/ enjoyment.

This is very important spiritual assistance and I believe the dream is telling you you can do this also. People (souls) then go to another shop, meaning another incarnation. When the shop closes (meaning the consciousness leaves the body), place looks dark and gloomy. Reference to food/death (reminded me of artist Lyubov Panchenko death in Ukraine). The second part whereby you have a choice to leave your shop in view or hide it, looks like a choice to offer your consciousness, light to others as a support when crossing over - like a 'ferry men'. You can do that during nightime sleep (with conscious commitment before going to bed). But it seem there is warning that this entails travelling to places where death is present (war zones, nursing homes, hospice etc) which could have certain impact on a being. Hiding the shop, replacing the windows with wood would be shielding away from this (protection boundaries). Window usually refers to clairvoyance /third eye, so that would be shut. It s a deep dream and I suggest you ponder on the messages it s giving you especially since you had a similar dream before.",2022-05-07 00:00:00,834,349,I’ve had this dream before.

This happens if we have a bunch of unresolved issues or trauma that bogs us down, and we find ourselves defensive or triggered often by daily occurances, we cannot respond to these with openness or full responsiveness, because we have shut ourselves down due to the fight, flight or freeze reaction. (I more and more think that the key to unconscious/ consciousness exploration is linked with the parasympathetic nervous system response. And that neuroscience is finding out what religion has said for a long time - that love is consciousness, the higher path, awareness.... it is only when we feel the safety of being loved that we can actually open our awareness with our higher faculties). And so many are stuck in this trap. Or puzzle or maze like an escape room. It is like a trap, because interestingly, we cannot truly figure out this unconscious reactivity this defensive triggered survival mode while we are actually in it. Neuroscience is saying this too. That you feel safe again first. THEN look at understanding the trigger. But first, get out of the hole you are in, to see from a wider perspective. Often, we get trapped in the survivalist mode because we try to figure it out from within that survivalist mode. For example, someone who feels triggered by another’s behavior might then identify that behavior as the cause of the trigger. But this doesn't actually go very far in understanding, overcoming, or resolution. It merely cements the knowledge that the world is unsafe and that we have to have our defenses up instead of trying to find common ground. The tunnels I think are a metaphor similar to the ""trances"" they often talk about in the new age (and sometimes psychology). The auto pilot mode, that is living unconsciously, without conscious awareness and choice making. ""Tunnel vision"" is seeing only the narrowest path in front of you and no way out. This can be like depression ""a long dark tunnel"". Tunneling into something also in a more positive way can be about obsessive focus on figuring out the originating path of some particular behavioral pattern. Sometimes I think we do have to delve deeply into an obsessive thought on a specific topic in order to understand that pattern in our life. But, as in your dream, the idea is to recall you are not just in a negative obsessive circular thought pattern. But that instead you are ""tunneling"" up and out, in order to find the secret way to unlock this particular unconscious behavioral pattern, to crack the code, to be able to stop unconsciously repeating it.",2022-05-01 14:52:31,196,558,,

Here, the struggle to find meaning of the unconscious while staying submerged in the unconscious. ""I was never good at that dance anyway, I gave it up when I had a family"". The defensive survivalist mode was never appealing for you to be stuck in, and having a family moved you further out of that. Which makes sense to me. To consciously choose to have a family, it requires a huge amount of hope and faith and optimism. And a longer view. And a broader understanding of the self, knowing that the lower self for example immediate needs is not the whole self, which allows one to have more patience and delayed gratification, more giving. Because you can think of not just the immediate self, but also the past and future selves, a very expansive view of self that takes us out of immediate reactivity and makes us look at a wider overview. Also though, the larger view of self and how that links with starting a family is the selfless love of having a family. That our well-being is now so palpably connected to ensuring the well-being of our family. It is a reminder we are not just alone, selfishness is very very narrow of a view.

I felt like that when my dad passed so I can imagine that feeling would be even stronger with a spouse. Maybe your dreams are about your inner conflict where you are torn between grieving him and wanting to stop grieving but feeling like you are supposed to grieve forever. Also, if you believe that loved ones can visit you in your dreams from the other side, it could be taken as a message from him that he wants you to move on and be happy without him. If you had passed instead of him, would you want him to be miserable and miss you for the rest of his life or would you be screaming at him from the other side to find happiness and live for the both of you?

It's possible that the two people are symbolic of someone else you know who is changing out putting and end to an old aspect of themselves.

My thoughts are that the dream is about the way you are progressing with your life. You know you need to clean things up. Perhaps you have some concerns that you are headed towards a risky or volatile future in some way. And this is a future to which you know you don’t belong. The engine I feel is about your inner self and your own personal source of power. What is if that makes ""your motor run""? What is if that gets you going in life, that gives you drive and motivation? Have lost your motivation for life? Do you need a tune up, because your dream suggests you need to clean this up too! Water can of course represent emotions and healing. Washing is a symbol of cleansing. The attendant is a part of you, the part that needs to pay attention and ""attend"" to these inner parts so you move forward with power. When you ""clean up"" this attendant part knows you will be fine. The bike suggests that you need to become more independent and to focus on your own very personal journey in life. There maybe some ghosts from your past that also need busting in order for you to do this. I feel the job you must do is to get some help and support. Who can you recruit or employ, to help you bust these ghosts? Perhaps a therapist or counselor? The cave is an ancient symbol for the inner dark caverns of our own self. The place where our shadow self hides. All the parts that we reject and repress, all the parts of our own selves that cause us trouble. Parts that have been hurt, insecurities, shame, anger etc. The witch and her husband suggest a sense of ""evil"" or badness you perhaps feel inhabits your own darkness. There is a clear family unit here too so there could be some links to you'd own family or upbringing. In my opinion this is a powerful dream that calls you to do some personal work and healing.

Despite the vehicle being new, there were visible scratches. Suddenly, the vehicle that I was in started to roll backwards. I struggled to stop the vehicle, but managed to figure it just moments prior to it rolling in the street . The vehicle's interior was quiet unique, and not at all what I am accustomed to. I couldn't figure out how to drive the vehicle forward towards the house. My husband came along to explain a few things about the vehicle. The dream changed and I was now sitting in the rear. There was a woman sitting in the driver's seat. Without warning the woman transformed into a dark green lizard. I was so frightened that I ran out of the vehicle.

He fights for truth, he stands against all that is ""bad"" in this world and stands up proudly for what he believes is right. The dream calls you to be the warrior in your own life.

As you move into the position of the wild authentic warrior you may come across those who wish to attack you, to see you fail or knock you down.

You say you spoke only to your father as he arrived at the scene when you saw the mess. You spoke about cleaning up the place. This to me indicates that you are using your power of discernment and action to engage in shadow-work. Shadow-work is about facing our shadows and cleaning up our psychological anchorages. It requires focus, courage, will power, determination, and discernment. These are all aspects of the Masculine side of the energy spectrum. The Father indicated that you'd be falling back on your learned Masculine ways to engage in this work. The Feminine side is about openness, acceptance, tolerance, patience etc. That remained in the background in your dream along with the young Masculine. You're engaging a specific section of your mind to do this inner work. The pigeons may symbolize your natural self, the unconditioned self trying to shine through your conditioned self. Excrement of any form in dreams is usually symbolic of creativity so your dream would imply you have immense potential waiting to be unleashed, which without active channeling has led to a scattered mess within. Perhaps the element of shyness or conditioning of ""right and wrong"" is playing a part in you stifling some aspects of yourself. You remove the ""curtains"" to clean them. That's symbolic of voluntarily uncovering the deeper wounds, the deeper self, and also symbolic of being open to Light (to enlightenment, to self-awareness) by willingly uncovering the access to your own Self. As there was more Light, you did see more of what you needed to ""clean"". This naturally happens when we go down this path of actively engaging in our spiritual ascension through shadow-work. More and more comes to light that needs to be transmuted. In each moment in life, we deal with the issue at hand to the best of our knowledge, capacity, and intentions at that given point. This may lead to discovering things that would leave us feeling demotivated, but our Masculine energies of persistence and courage always come in handy. The dream was interrupted, but I believe it has conveyed to you the message it carried. You're subconsciously growing into a new person because the global environment has been changing drastically, yet on some levels imperceptibly. The same dynamic is being reflected in all individuals based on our unique circumstances.

I realize that there are also cat toys on fire too. There are two kittens, but it seems that everything they touch is becoming enflamed. One of the cats bats a toy my way and suddenly it’s on fire. One of the cats is playing under a coffee table and the toy/carpet is on fire so much it singes her fur! I grab the cat and cry because she’s singed but it doesn’t seem hurt then. I tell the other person the cats are setting things on fire, as they seem unaware. They snap back at me and then me: “it’s YOUR cat setting everything on fire!!!” I quickly realize that somehow they set a couch on fire, mainly the arm of the couch. The foam inside is smoldering. I run to get a bucket, but the first one is broken. The next one is full of dirty water, so I try and flush it down the toilet but it goes everywhere and the bucket proceeds to break too. I run to the kitchen to get a large cup just to slow the smoldering. But the water pressure is low and it’s taking forever. I fill the cup as much as I can and run to extinguish the fire. I keep going back for more water, and eventually find that the foam is smoldering near the floor, so I focus my attention there. Soon the foam reaches the floor/carpet and starts to set it on fire too. Now I’m aiming at the floor, as the smoldering has turned to actual fire. The floor becomes completely engulfed in flames and I can’t do anything except watch the flames crawl across the floor and up the wall.

You could also be feeling consumed by something, this could be with sadness which could result in a lack of motivation which was shown at the beginning. Your dream does seem to show you trying to heal and I think you need to give yourself time to be able to do this.

722,1602225336,"In the dream, I bought a house. I was in a different country, though I don’t know which ones. From the outside, it seemed tiny, dainty. Inside it was beautiful. Each floor was very small, painted lavender, and there were maybe about seven stories. Like my own personal tower. The rooms were full of furniture from the previous owner. It started off amazing. Me, my mother (my mother lives in another country) and my best friend and her husband were cleaning the place out. I was keeping the furniture I did want, giving away others. One the rooms was a children’s room, with a small bed and a crib, both made of golden coloured metal. I gave the crib to my friend, as in my dream she was either newly pregnant or trying for a baby. As we were emptying that room, someone got a call that a local boy had been kicked out of his house by his awful father. We all knew of him. I told her to tell the kid he could stay here, in this room until he could go home or figure something out. The boy never showed up in the dream, but somewhere around that conversation is when things started to go wrong. My friend took a shower and saw someone looking at her from the drain. We checked every drain, and every drain in the house had someone looking through it. Like all you could see was the eyeball, looking up. The floorboards were suddenly rotten, they looked fine, but I’d step on them and they’d start to collapse down. I fell through the floor and into the basement of the house. I contacted an insurance agent, and when I explained the issues he started to laugh, hysterically. Then that scene disappeared and suddenly I was someone else, a teen girl, trying desperately to pretend I went to a school I know I didn’t, trying to get this group of people to let me go somewhere with them. And not in the way of a teen just wanting to be included, they were doing something dangerous or bad and this girl, for some reason, needed to gain their trust, have them underestimate her, so she could find out what it was. It felt like her life depended on it. They ended up letting her tag along, but I woke up as soon as they started to walk away with her.",2022-04-30 04:10:07,0,1,1410494179472236,780839497,"The house represents you I think, and doing a self spring clean, going through changes.

My suspicion is that the dream characters are symbols of aspects of yourself and not about those people external to you in waking. In that context I'd see your child as either an inner child aspect or maybe, and I think given the scene with the car as a symbol of the personal journey this is how I would lean, that he is a symbol of your personal development (the new version if you that has come out of you). Your partner I think is representing your intellect (masculine as thinking vs feminine as feeling). So I would see this as saying your inner child or developing self has been attacked but you don't understand how or why, and are intellectually refusing to contemplate it. And in that refusal you are as a result also refusing to continue your journey (not driving). I think the walker might be tied to that too, like you have the option to engage your analytical mind and figure what is causing this issue and resolve the problem at its root, or you can stop your personal growth journey, put up with the symptoms (walker as a support dealing with being in a disabled state).",2022-05-01 14:54:12,447,261,So I have weird dreams quite often and they are usually very vivid.

We have changed back diapers now to see if the diaper was the problem he also has a form of eczema so he has itchy skin at times .

The way they end up dying is that Chucky (you know, the creepy doll) runs around underneath the platform with his hand out, grabbing the kid’s hands, and if the kid squeezes his hand back then he sentences them to death by chasing after them with a huge knife. I eventually caught onto this, so I stopped squeezing his little hand whenever he’d put it out and he was like “fucksakes, this bitch is gonna be a tricky one” or something (sorry for the language).

Besides the illegible text at the top, there was an all-seeing eye right in the middle. Suddenly red and blue lights flashed behind it alternatively, like cop car lights, VIVIDLY and almost neon and overly saturated. Fog started rolling out behind the sign from the lights, and the “video” started zooming in slowly towards the sign while rotating. The focus was always on the sign. After that, I returned to my nondescript dream that I was in prior to that. It very much felt like someone had hacked my dream to show me this scene, like an urgent message.

813,905592076730541,Packing up my dorm room trying to make sure I have all of my stuff because Once leave I can’t go back. In previous dreams I can never get everything packed to fit in my bags and take with me. last night I had family helping. my (divorced sense I was age 1) mom and dad helped. My dad drove out to wherever I was to put big things that wouldn’t fit on plane In his tiny car. My mom flew out to help. once we were ready to get on plane to head home my kids and cat showed up. I watched as they all buckled up and got ready for take off. But I was outside the window/door watching. I ended up missing the flight as it took off I was panicked. Not for me for my mom because she would be worried about me left alone in an unfamiliar place so late at night. I told her I’m ok I’ll catch the next one that was coming at 3 am. No biggie. ITS Ok! IM OK! is what I was yelling to her as the plane took off. The people in the airport looked worried for me till i said no I’m good I’m worried about her worrying. Then all the sudden I’m back in dorm room packing with my dad. He had helped take all the pictures of loved ones and special things down off the walls. We had almost everything packed up he was fitting my king size bed in his tiny car along with other large objects. I was just going to ride home with him I though why wait for the next plane. He said he was going to come back Monday and buy a pice of furniture I was leaving behind and even though I wanted the piece still I was like ok my loss his gain. He’s helping that’s what’s right I’ll find a new one. Then all the sudden he was gone and one of my kids was with me. we were packing anything else we could find before the next plane came. Odd thing here was we were packing purses and other to go bags into our bag to bring. Once I was on the plane my kid turned into one of my dogs and our other dog was outside the plane barking and now it was snowing. I looked out the window saw her and told the people not to take off. They opened the planes long back hatch like on a military plane to let her in and she came running up. I could feel the coldness coming from her. then i watched the snow melting once she sat next to me and I could feel the warmth of her snuggle. Then we were ready to take off but I told them I had to pee before the plane took off. The flight attendant was not happy bc I did the same thing last time before the plane almost took off. Turns out I had to pee for real so I got up and that was my dream. Normally I can’t find my ticket or lose track of time is why I miss plane. I also never have helpers or get packed up as far as I did last night. The only thing that was holding me up from taking off this time was my bladder. The one time I did take off on the plane in the dream the windows were open and my pets were all stuffed in a crumbling cage bc they had to be in cages to be on the plane.

I’ll preface the dream that everything in the dream is you/aspect of you and so finding this ornate desk in a yard sale symbolism is a dream's way of saying you need to find (and appreciate) your own beauty and by going further inside /opening certain part of you/checking the inside, you are to discover your value. Yard sale would indicate some sentiment around old stuff/no longer serving/but also letting go as people are usually doing it when decluttering/ moving on. There is a feeling of guilt that has surfaced in the dream but try to work with and identify the presence of this feeling in your body away from the actual imagery (which the dream is just using to open your eyes to this guilt). Sometimes giving yourself the permission to find your beauty and value (again) will come with a hinged guilt attached ('who do you think you are' type of voice) and this guilt can be cultural and societal /passed down the family line..not to absolve from our own, but do take a wider view when looking at this.

I was then taken to a field doctor to stitch me up.

However you aren't fearful about or afraid of being wounded. The bullets might represent what is wounding you. The different caliber bullets might be symbolizing some wounds are more significant than others. The numbers associated with the calibers could be significant to the dream meaning. Two might be related to a partnership. Four symbolizes stability and 5 is the number of change and freedom. You might feel that while you are capable you might need some professional help to heal/move past some of those wounds.,2022-05-04 00:00:00,136,111,,

I took them back to her and freaked out on her yelling. Her and her friends started looking for the shoe. It was taking forever; she got in my face and I told her to get out of my face or I would fight her. She didn’t so I punched her but it was a slow punch, I hit her face where her glasses where and didn’t think it hurt her but she said OWE and started crying. We where all of a sudden in her sober house and I was talking a bunch of smack to her and her friends calling them low life’s.

Being in the room you shared tells me that the dream is about the mindset you occupy around this issue. There are always many threads to the symbols and lots of different ways to approach them. My interpretation is just one suggestion. It seems the room has been cleared in preparation of remodelling and renovation. Your psyche needs an update in some way. Yet you used the word ""barren"" so it may also be that this space internally has become a barren and empty place for you. I wonder if you have tried to clear away the issue in some way, or you just want to paint it over and cover up what happened. Maybe that's something you tried to do when you were young. Baby blue suggests an innocence. A color we might paint for a new baby's room. Blue is the color of the throat chakra, the center of our communication, it invites us to talk and express ourselves, especially verbally. It's also a color of peace and tranquility. I feel that the painting is a way of saying i want to start again. I want to prepare for a new beginning, to clear away the old and welcome in the new. The color is ""light"" and insights those themes too. But the man seems to have too much power because he is always able to undo your efforts. Red is a very emotive color bringing them of lust, passion, danger and anger. I feel the scene is describing what occupies your mental space over the issue. It seems he is still able to take over and ""color”"" things. I’m sure this experience in many ways has ""colored"" or informed the rest of your life, perhaps with a darkness. Your asking him to stop is very positive because you recognize the unwanted and ongoing influence in your life. But your pleas and physical attempts to make it stop are not working. And I feel this probably the crux of it. It's very very sad and unfair, this man violated you when you were a powerless. He broke the law, the trust of your family and broke every sacred boundary that is held by good decent loving people. The softball racket I feel represents your efforts as a child who nearly did not have the power to make it stop by her own efforts. That was not your fault and I feel the dream is repeating because it wants to call you forward as the adult you now are. It's replaying this internal video because its still playing out in various ways within you. You need to address the issue to get the dream to change and hopefully stop. The painting shows that you want to start over. Painting your own childhood room and the location of your pain, suggests you want to welcome the child who you were. She still lives within you, painting her room in a new and fresh way invites healing and safety and a way to refresh yourself for a new start.",2022-05-02 00:00:00,294,706," I have a reoccurring dream about the man who used to molest me as a teenager and I need help to understand what it means, I feel like there has to be a reason I keep having it.",I wake up having cried in reality during my sleep.

That may or may not also have ties work and career. Something about your teenage self is obscuring your outlook and your view is broken in some way. Think about how old the teens were in the dream and what was going on for you at that age. If it were my dream I would be looking for my own behaviors then and seeing what traits I still hold. It may be the ""I don't care"" is an arrogance you hold, this could be a reactionary habit formed at that time in order to self protect. I feel that the confrontation is about looking at yourself and confronting the issue. What has been broken within you and what is responsible for that damage? How have the events of your teenage years damaged your ability to move forward with clear sight. I feel the need to contact the parents suggests that you would like your own parents or upbringing to take some responsibility for the damage. The manager is you and your own internal management system. It may be that you have a lot of repressed anger and rage carried forward from that time. The ""I don't care"" might be an attitude formed though not being able to change a situation.

All my family, brother, mom, dad, grandpa and grandpa, aunts etc was sitting around a table, eating dinner. Then I “woke up”, and I was all alone by the table. So I woke up from a dream, in my dream.

Crying and screaming in my sleep, + it freaks my bf out. My dad committed suicide 12 years ago, I was 11 at the time. I had a tough time dealing with it for many years, but I’ve been working on letting go and move on for about 3 years. The dreams are very different, but it’s always the same pattern: my dad comes back for a day, week, month, and he totally ignores me. I try to talk to him but he just pushed me away and talk to everyone else. Then when it’s time for him to go back to “heaven” (I’m not a religious person), he tells me he loves me and misses me, and that I have to move on. And then I scream and cry and wake up crying."," and then I woke up crying. It feels like the more I’m working on moving on from my past, my dreams about family and dad gets worse. I don’t know what to do or what it means. Have anyone experienced something like this or know what it means?"
1531,100008611569028,"There was a male individual that was ousted from my family for something he didn't do. Rather than siding with my family on this one I believed in him as I knew he could never have done what he was being accused of. At some point, things escalated where my family was planning to chase him away, so the both of us left. We ended up splitting when we left and I somehow ended up in my dad's apartment. No one was present but his wife, and there was a Golden Retriever there. He was filthy, and as I tried to hose him down I could see all the dirt and grime coming off of him. I thought there was no way I could let him stay there. Well, I happened to look around and also saw there was a baby, and the baby needed it's diaper changed. That's when my dads wife came in and I became angry, telling her I was going to take the baby as it was obvious she was unfit to take care of her. She was pretty calm during the whole interaction but tried to take her baby back, but eventually relented and went back to her room while I changed the baby. By the end of it all, I realized that I was just overreacting. At least, in terms of the baby, as it wasn't like she had been crying and put two and two together and figured the baby had probably just made a mess and it wasn't his wife's fault. However, there was definitely no excusing the neglected dog. I went into her room with the baby and apologized, telling her I knew she was a good mom and that I was sorry for attempting to take her baby, that I knew she would never forgive me if I had taken her. His wife told me it was alright, that the reason why she didn't fight so hard is because she knew I would make the right decision. She then told me, for whatever reason, that if I wanted from now on I could come and fold her laundry and she's pay me $1.75 every time I did her laundry. I told her no thanks and was planning to leave with the dog.",2022-04-20 09:47:35,1,1,1401800630341591,100009042510759,This is about you evolving and taking a stand for yourself in life. Standing up for the male individual was you speaking up for yourself. Taking a stand in life. You speak your peace about the baby but realize that you may have pushed it a bit too much. It's because you are learning about loyalty and how it fits or works in your life. That is why you are cleaning the dog off. This represents your loyalty because dogs are very loyal. You are learning the value of being loyal and becoming loyal to the truth. That is what I see with this dream.,2022-04-17 15:07:54,501,115,,I woke up feeling very sad and guilty.
