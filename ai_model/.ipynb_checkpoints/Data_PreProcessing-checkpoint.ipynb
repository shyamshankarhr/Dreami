    "The clustering was not helpfull. We decide to sort the posts and comments by length, to get a subjective impression of what length constitutes a good dream-txt and interpretation. We are going to use that as a cutoff. What is noticable is that the shorter dream posts are questions about particular dream-symbols like: \"This is the second night I dreamt about elevators. What do elevators mean?\". These questions about symbols are not so usefull and don't match our Jungian psychological theory about dreams. We are interested in narrative dream-texts. The meaning of elements is found in the relationship to the whole dream-narrative. We are going to filter out, so that we only have narrative dream-texts."

At one point, we talk about going onto the roof and the staircase is a spiral going up at least 10 floors on the outside. One of the women seems to speed up it like sonic the hedgehog in front of me. On the roof, it’s obvious we are in a mountain town and it’s lit with string lights and super pretty. An old man comes up from what seems to be a ladder on the side of the building on the other side from us and he motions to us saying something like, hey is this yours? He seems like a grounds keeper or building manager. We walk over and there’s a few benches with towels and unwrapped (but really neatly laid) condoms on them. I said something like “no, that must have been the people here before us?” And I had this grossed out feeling. He acts a bit funny about it, seems to be mad at us and then leaves. We keep talking and then he appears again right in front of us coming over onto the roof but this time he seems like he’s turned into an alien with a squid-like face. One of the guy leans down towards him and all of a sudden I become the alien and I shoot my tentacles at his mouth, punch a hole I. The back of his head and rip his mouth off to where there’s just a gaping black hole where it used to be but no blood. ;  Background_Info: Overall I only have wild, violent dreams and stopped dreaming for years until I read Alchemy: an introduction to the symbolism and psychology. I often feel I’m half awake and just following the journey and don’t wake up anxious or stressed, usually just super weirded out. ;  Wakeup_State: __'"
