    "On dreami.day, users will be able to get dream-interpretations generated by GPT-3 through an API to Opean-AI. Models can be fine-tuned to specialize in specific tasks. We have to provide pairs of dreams and dream-interpretations. The model then learns to generate dream-interpretations from dream input. We scraped two facebook groups to get intitial data.\n",

What is noticeable is that the shorter dream posts are questions about particular dream-symbols like: \"This is the second night I dreamt about elevators. What do elevators mean?\". These questions about symbols are not so useful and don't match our Jungian psychological theory about dreams. We are interested in narrative dream-texts. The meaning of elements is found in the relationship to the whole dream-narrative. We are going to filter out, so that we only have narrative dream-texts."

There are lots of people walking around trying to find the way out, but getting nowhere. One of them is an old dancing partner when I was taking ballroom dancing lessons. I get the impression of a long time searching for the proper path. The focus of the dream is when I come to an old temple, Ancient Greek-ish with a large granite statue, specifically granite with a rustic pinkish hue. Looking up into the temple roof I realise no one is up there and it dawns on me that the path is likely up there as no one down here has found the way, so I head up there. The dream then goes to an out of body view of the path. There is an above ground bridge like structure, and the way corkscrews as a tunnel around it. Because its a tunnel everyone assumes its underground, but it isn't, its not logical. That's the trick. ;  Background_Info: __ ;  Wakeup_State: __\""
